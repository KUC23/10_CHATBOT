This 300-year-old farming village was abandoned in the 1960s. Now residents are moving back,https://edition.cnn.com/world/asia/hong-kong-hakka-village-sustainability-hnk-spc/index.html,"Editor’s Note: Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.

Surrounded by forest-covered mountains cloaked in mist, a patchwork quilt of green farmland and steel-blue waves breaking on mangrove-strewn mudflats, Lai Chi Wo does not look like it belongs in Hong Kong.

The remote 300-year-old village is one of the city’s oldest settlements — and one of its most biodiverse.

Its location is no accident: it draws on the traditional philosophies of the Hakka people, one of Hong Kong’s pre-colonial indigenous groups, who built the settlement.

“We maintain what is called a feng-shui forest, to preserve the village,” says Susan Wong. The 73-year-old grandmother is the village chief, and was born in Lai Chi Wo, when the town was home to around 1,000 residents. “From our ancestors to now, it has been passed down, not to let anyone cut down the trees. If you cut all the trees out, the mountain will become bare, and nothing can cover the village.”

Feng shui — which literally means “wind” and “water” — is a design philosophy about how homes, villages and cities should be arranged for good fortune.

In Lai Chi Wo, the position of the forest is intended to shelter the village from typhoons, prevent landslides, and manage extreme heat and cold.

However, in the 1960s, residents began to leave their ancestral home: Hong Kong was industrializing rapidly, and it was becoming hard to make a living from farming.

“We didn’t even have shoes or clothes to wear,” Wong recalls. Lai Chi Wo is so remote that, even today, it can only be reached by a three-hour hike through the jungle, or a long boat trip around the coast.

In the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s, many families emigrated overseas — like Wong’s, who moved to the UK when she was 15 — for better opportunities, and elderly residents passed away.

Lai Chi Wo became a ghost town.

Restoring a community
Over the decades that Lai Chi Wo lay empty, buildings crumbled, and farmland grew wild with weeds. The roots of banyan trees twined around open doorways, and wild boar or lost hikers were the only foot traffic through the decaying village.

But Lai Chi Wo was not entirely forgotten.

“Elsewhere in Hong Kong, many abandoned villages had houses collapsed beyond recognition and vegetation invaded the whole village,” says Chiu Ying Lam, head of the Hong Kong Countryside Foundation. However, when he first visited Lai Chi Wo in 2009, he was surprised to find several homes were well maintained.

Lam speculated that these absentee homeowners were still connected to their ancestral home, and were planning to return one day, perhaps to retire. This sparked an idea that would eventually become the Sustainable Lai Chi Wo program: a decade-long collaboration between NGOs, universities and government agencies to restore the village to its former glory.

In re-establishing the community, the unique biodiversity around the village could be protected too, says Lam.

Over the years, Lam estimates around HK$100 million ($12.8 million) in funding from businesses, non-profits and the Hong Kong government has been invested into the village’s redevelopment, including the restoration of five hectares of farmland and the reconstruction of 15 dilapidated homes.

While the project aimed to bring back former residents, it also wanted to bring in new people. In 2015, Ah Him Tsang and his wife, who are not Hakka, were one of the first families to move to the village, looking for a life “closer to nature” to raise their then-infant son.

Like many residents in Lai Chi Wo, Tsang works a variety of jobs: he grows vegetables and cash crops on a small farm, and on weekends, runs “Hakka Experience” homestays and a store that serves locally grown tea, coffee, and homemade vegan ice cream to tourists who pass through.

“I also grow these vegetables for my staycation program, (for a) farm-to-table dining experience,” says Tsang, adding that the Hakka Experience is designed to give visitors a more authentic experience of village life. “You can really feel the quietness, the serenity of the nature here. I hope more people can stay longer and enjoy the slow pace.”

Homecoming
The influx of new residents to Lai Chi Wo encouraged more of the original residents to move back, too.

Upon retiring, Wong returned to Hong Kong from the UK to care for her elderly parents, and heard about the revitalization project.

In 2019, she decided to return to the village with her now-103-year-old father, into the home they were both born in. “I’m very happy because I like this village. I have so many friends (who have) come back,” she says.

With her father, Wong runs a small farm, growing mandarin oranges, lemons, chilis, flowers, and vegetables, and uses organic agriculture techniques, such as grinding up discarded oyster shells to make plant food.

The project also introduced new crops like coffee, which grows in the shade. This agroforestry technique protects the forest by growing high-value plants around the perimeter of the native woodland, while boosting profits for farmers.

Lai Chi Wo now has around 700 coffee plants across several farms, making it the “biggest coffee-producing region in Hong Kong,” says Ryan Siu Him Leung, senior project officer at the Centre for Civil Society and Governance at the University of Hong Kong, which oversaw parts of Lai Chi Wo’s revitalization program.

The University of Hong Kong is leasing some of the land for experimental farming, and helping villagers turn their crops into higher-value products in a licensed food processing plant in nearby Sha Tau Kok, on Hong Kong’s border with mainland China. Products include pickles and unusual fruit jams, or seasonal foods like popular radish cake for Chinese New Year, says Leung.

“We’re also looking at traditional Hakka recipes, and trying to explore the possibility of turning those recipes into commercial products,” he says, adding that they are currently selling via local supermarket suppliers and pop-up farmers markets, and plan to launch an online shop soon, to reach more customers.

A model for redevelopment
While the project has garnered positive attention — including recognition from UNESCO in 2020 for cultural heritage conservation and sustainable development — it’s not all been smooth sailing.

There’s been resistance from some of the original villagers, who claim they were not properly consulted about the redevelopment.

Additionally, more than a decade into the project, the village is still not financially sustainable, and is supported by external funding, including government subsidies for the farmers.

Farming at such a small scale is largely unprofitable; so like Tsang, most residents have multiple income streams. Leung says that most of the new residents work remote jobs online, or in creative industries, with farming as a hobby where any income is a bonus.

Leung says that, aside from preserving the town’s traditional lifestyle, there’s an ecological advantage to maintaining the farmland: sustainable agriculture helps to better manage water drainage and improve soil health.

Even if the village isn’t economically independent, he feels it’s worthwhile, and that cultivating a sustainable community is more important. “As long as there are people willing to stay in the village, and they are making their living — to me, it’s financially viable for those individual households.”

The project has become a model for sustainable revitalization, and the Forest Village Project, launched in 2024, is applying the lessons from Lai Chi Wo to two nearby hamlets, Mui Tsz Lam and Kop Tong. These settlements are around one-tenth the size of Lai Chi Wo, says Leung, but they both have a feng shui woodland, diverse flora and fauna, and offer the potential to develop a wider eco-tourism destination.

“Hopefully, we could have a more comprehensive region of revitalized villages, which (could be) a bigger attraction to the wider (Hong Kong) community,” Leung adds."
What happens to celebrities’ outfits after a red carpet event?,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/06/style/celebrity-red-carpet-outfits-what-happens/index.html,"Every time a celebrity poses on a red carpet, countless cameras flash, forever immortalizing their outfit, preserving the hundreds or even thousands of hours it has taken to create.

Sunday night’s Golden Globes were no different, with Zendaya channeling old Hollywood glamor in a saffron Louis Vuitton gown, Angelina Jolie wearing a dazzling crystal chain McQueen dress and Tilda Swinton donning a custom embroidered Chanel jacket.

Online, such red carpet outfits have long afterlives as they are shared around social media, dissected by influencers and journalists alike. But the real-life fate of the garments themselves is less well-publicized. What happens to them after their moment of fame — where do they go and when are they seen again?

The afterlives of outfits can take many different forms — some are kept in storage, some are displayed at exhibitions, some wend their way onto the open market and are auctioned, and some are bought by the celebrities wearing them. Occasionally, some don’t even survive the night.

Over the past two decades, the outfits worn by celebrities at red carpet events have garnered more and more attention, and consequently significance, said Lucy Bishop, a specialist in handbags and fashion at auction house Sotheby’s.

She pinpoints the Dior chartreuse embroidered gown designed by John Galliano and worn by Nicole Kidman at the 1997 Oscars as one of the earliest turning points that “changed the trajectory of red-carpet dressing,” signaling the start of fashion houses “very publicly partnering with a celebrity and sort of officially dressing them for the red carpet.”

“Before, it wasn’t such a formal partnership,” she told CNN.

It ushered in an age in which teams of stylists and designers are all involved in creating and realizing a red-carpet look, particularly for the highest profile events like the Met Gala and the Oscars. As such, the incentives for preserving the immense work required to produce these looks are much higher.

“Those days of a gown being packed away and forgotten about for many years and rediscovered are sadly gone,” Bishop added. “Now, often when a gown is worn on the red carpet, there is usually a plan put in place for where that gown will end up.”

Most of the time, fashion houses are responsible for this plan since they often own the red-carpet outfits they designed, though a few celebrities acquire specific gowns for themselves.

Kim Kardashian told Vogue in May that she had every one of her Met Gala outfits “saved” in her wardrobe, except the iconic Marilyn Monroe dress she wore two years ago before returning it to Ripley’s Believe It or Not!, which had loaned it to her for the event. Similarly, Zendaya bought the black taffeta 1996 Givenchy by Galliano gown she wore at last year’s Met Gala, her stylist said in an interview.

Preserving the gowns
The very first thing that happens to a red-carpet outfit after an event is a cleaning process, said Sarah Scaturro, chief conservator at the Cleveland Museum of Art. The person wearing the outfit “might have on body lotions, oils, perfumes, makeup and even if you don’t see that right away … over time, these materials and stains can actually start to oxidize and they will start changing the color of the fabric, and maybe even the texture,” she told CNN.

Usually that process involves dry cleaning, but it can sometimes involve wet cleaning or simply vacuuming and brushing the garment, if everything else is impossible, Scaturro added.

Once garments have been cleaned, they almost always end up in a specialized storage facility — such as a fashion house’s archive or a private one, like that of Julie Ann Clauss, founder of The Wardrobe, an archiving and storage studio.

The outfits remain here for years, meticulously maintained and preserved, only leaving if they are selected for exhibitions or to be worn again — an increasingly common practice with the rise of vintage fashion on the red carpet.

Clauss and her team carefully consider how best to preserve the roughly 100,000 pieces in their safekeeping — from the low light levels and controlled temperature and humidity levels, to the specific way in which the garment is stored.

“It’s really a case-by-case basis about how each particular item is mounted or stored,” she said. “So some things hang, some things are boxed, and some things have to be mounted, meaning they’re on, like a dress form, because these things are designed to be worn. They’re not really designed to hang or to be laying flat.”

Some leave for a time if they are selected for exhibitions, like last year when Britain’s Kensington Palace hosted a “Crown to Couture” exhibition.

It featured several iconic looks, including the Marilyn Monroe-inspired tulle Oscar de la Renta dress worn by Billie Eilish at the 2021 Met Gala, the showstopping “Sun God” outfit worn by Billy Porter as he was carried into the 2019 event on a velvet litter, Rihanna’s 2021 voluminous Balenciaga black coat dress, and the glittering gold Peter Dundas dress Beyoncé wore for the 2017 Grammys.

In this way, these outfits become like pieces of art, their craftsmanship preserved and admired from a distance, no longer really clothes but exhibits and artifacts that will be studied by some future historian.

Getting outfits to these exhibitions is its own daunting task, too. Clauss recalled recently helping a client transport outfits for a tour that were “like these three dimensional, huge things, but fine beading, heavy crystals on really delicate stretch tulle fabric.”

“I was like: ‘Guys we can’t put these in a box…’” she said. “They need custom mounts made so they’re stable flying internationally and then they need to have a crate built around it. You see these crates and they’re tremendous, sometimes they’re like seven feet tall for a dress.”

An unexpected discovery
Before red carpet dressing became so important for the fashion houses from the 1990s onwards, it was more common for a gown to be kept by the person who wore it, who would sometimes give it away or sell it on the open market, said Bishop.

Most famously, Elizabeth Taylor gave away the Dior gown she wore to collect her Oscar and, instead of ending up in the Dior archives, the dress was found packed away in a suitcase belonging to her friend and former employee Anne Sanz. It later fetched $200,000 at an auction, according to Kerry Taylor Auctions.

Even today, gowns are occasionally found on the open market, sometimes by taking unconventional routes.

After the 2019 Golden Globes, Lady Gaga allegedly left her billowing periwinkle gown in her hotel room where it was later picked up by a housekeeper who turned it in to the lost and found at the Beverly Hilton hotel.

The Valentino haute couture gown spent months there before the housekeeper said the hotel “gave it to me as a gift” and offered it up at an auction, though it’s unclear whether the sale ultimately went ahead. (CNN reached out to Nate D. Sanders Auctions, which handled the sale, and Valentino, for comment.)

Then there’s the garments that don’t even survive the night. For her entrance to the Met Gala last year, singer Tyla wore a custom Balmain dress, encased with three shades of sand mixed with micro crystal studs for extra depth, and it proved to be one of the most striking and innovative looks of the night.

But later that evening after the red carpet event, designer Olivier Rousteing cut the long skirt off with scissors, allowing Tyla to walk after she had needed four men to carry her up the museum’s steps. Like the sands of time it represented, the dress had run its course."
"Apple backs its diversity policies, calling anti-DEI proposal ‘restricting’",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/apple-dei-companies/index.html,"Apple’s board of directors has recommended shareholders vote against a conservative think tank’s proposal to consider scrapping the tech giant’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

“At Apple, we believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apple’s success as making the best products in the world. We seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and our Business Conduct and Compliance policies are foundational to how we do business,” the company said Friday in its proxy statement.

The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) notified Apple in September that it intends to submit the anti-DEI proposal at Apple’s annual shareholder meeting on February 25. If passed by shareholders, it would require Apple to consider eliminating some or all of its DEI policies.

But Apple said the proposal “inappropriately attempts to restrict” and “micromanage” company operations and policies. The company also said it has a “well-established compliance program,” and its board actively manages business and legal conduct to ensure it complies with laws in multiple jurisdictions.

Stefan Padfield, executive director of the NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, said DEI poses risks, including litigation, customer backlash and divisiveness among employees, that outweigh the benefits.

The NCPPR said that Apple “likely has over 50,000 who are potentially victims of this type of discrimination.” The NCPPR said if any employees sue the company, Apple could lose “tens of billions of dollars.”

“We are simply asking for a consideration. The proposal, if approved, would not automatically result in the abolishment of DEI,” Padfield told CNN. He called Apple’s statement “non-responsive” and said that “corporations that have been pushing DEI have lost the goodwill to simply say ‘trust us.’”

DEI isn’t new. Neither is the backlash
Apple’s diversity programs aren’t new. Its supplier diversity program was established in 1993 and works with various nonprofits, including the National Minority Supplier Development Council and National Veterans Business Development Council. Apple also hired its first vice president of inclusion and diversity in 2017 and has 67 employee groups known as “diversity network associations,” the first of which was established in 1986.

But other companies are abandoning their commitments or renaming programs to “appear more palatable” to the incoming Trump administration and other critics, said Nani Vishwanath, a consultant and facilitator of DEI and employee experiences at the Courage Collective.

Meta, John Deere and Walmart are among the companies that have made such changes to their DEI commitments following pressure from right-wing activists, legal groups, customers and President-elect Donald Trump.

Changing DEI programs doesn’t necessarily shield a company from further backlash. McDonald’s, which announced on January 6 that it would roll back DEI practices, was sued Sunday by the American Alliance for Equal Rights, an anti-affirmative action group. The lawsuit claims the fast food company did not fully adhere to its commitment to treat “everyone” fairly because it kept a college scholarship program for Hispanic and Latino high school students.

Other companies aren’t buckling to demand. The NCPPR has made similar proposals to shareholders of major companies, including retail giant Costco, whose board of directors recommended shareholders vote against DEI policies.

“Those who are staying fiercely committed understand how it’s imperative,” Vishwanath said.

Vishwanath said DEI is “vastly misunderstood” and companies don’t always understand why they implemented the programs. DEI efforts were originally intended to advance the representation of people from various identities and backgrounds, and this affected employee trainings, resource networks and recruiting practices. But there isn’t a single definition for DEI, which has complicated its implementation.

She said these misunderstandings cause inconsistency with DEI initiatives. She suggested companies should ask themselves if DEI policies were “a reactive add-on or was it intrinsically important to the company’s success?”

“(DEI) will continue to be met with curiosity or resentment,” said Vishwanath. “For organizations to remain relevant and meaningful to both their internal and external audiences, they need to think about what practices they need to evolve.”"
"Grammys and Oscars to proceed amid LA fires, but will put the spotlight on first responders",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/entertainment/oscars-grammys-award-season-la-wildfires/index.html,"As they say in Hollywood, the show must go on.

On Monday, it was announced that both the Grammys and Oscars would proceed as planned on February 2 and March 2, respectively, answering a question that has been debated behind the scenes by decision makers tasked with figuring out how to proceed with award season as Los Angeles grapples with devastating wildfires.

Some stars, like Jean Smart and Patricia Arquette, have called for award shows to be cancelled or re-focused as charitable telethons to raise funds for the fires.


Award season – the Golden Globes, Grammys, SAG Awards, Oscars and more – is a glitzy time in Hollywood. Watching well-paid stars take the stage to collect awards while thousands of LA families are displaced and have lost their homes runs the risk of being tone deaf, but economically, these shows also provide income for thousands of entertainment workers from caterers to drivers to lighting professionals who are integral to the industry.

The Grammys are the first show to announce they will proceed amid the wildfires, but the show will be reimagined to put the spotlight on first responders and also will include a charitable component.

“In challenging times, music has the power to heal, comfort, and unite like nothing else,” Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. and chair of the board of Trustees Tammy Hurt said in a letter to Recording Academy members on Monday. “The Grammys will not only honor the artistry and achievements of our music community but also serve as a platform to amplify the spirit of resilience that defines this great city of Los Angeles.”

The letter said that the show will proceed as planned in close coordination with local authorities to “ensure public safety and responsible use of area resources,” and that the ceremony will “carry a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.”

Last week, the Recording Academy and its charitable arm, MusiCares, launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with an initial $1 million donation to support music creatives and professionals. Now, with additional contributions, the find has distributed more than $2 million in emergency aid and will continue its ongoing efforts.

The Grammys are the next major televised award show to air on February 2.

The Critics Choice Awards on E! were set to be hosted by Chelsea Handler on January 12 in Santa Monica – an area close to the Palisades fire – but were postponed last week. They are currently set to take place at the end of January.

The Oscars has a longer timeline to determine next steps. The show is currently set to proceed on March 2, the Academy announced on Monday.

Oscars voting has also now been extended through January 17, and the nominations announcement has been rescheduled for January 23 and will be held virtually instead of in-person. (Last week, the Academy had already pushed back the voting window and nominations.)

The Oscars nominees luncheon, where nominees are feted, has been cancelled this year.

“We are all devastated by the impact of the fires and the profound losses experienced by so many in our community. The Academy has always been a unifying force within the film industry, and we are committed to standing together in the face of hardship,” Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang, said in a letter to members on Monday.

“Our members always share how important it is for us to come together as a community, and we are determined to use this opportunity to celebrate our resilient and compassionate industry,” the letter added. “We also look forward to honoring our frontline workers who have aided with the fires, recognizing those impacted, and encouraging people to join the Academy in supporting the relief efforts.”

As CNN reported last week, many key award season events have been postponed. The annual AFI Awards luncheon, which was set to be held on January 10, will be rescheduled, and the annual BAFTA Tea Party was cancelled.

Over the weekend, the Producers Guild Awards postponed their nominations announcement for the second time “out of care and concern for those being affected by the fires.” And on Monday, the Writers Guild Awards postponed their nominations “until further notice” due to the ongoing fires, the organization said in a statement to CNN.

The Screen Actors Guild Awards are scheduled for February 23. Last week, the actors’ union donated $1 million to the SAG-AFTRA Foundation for fire relief."
Risks from ash and air pollution remain for people returning after wildfires. Here’s how to stay safe,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/health/la-wildfires-air-pollution-symptoms-safety/index.html,"As some people return to the structures spared from Los Angeles wildfires, experts warn that they should be careful of the air inside and especially cautious when cleaning up. Smoke, ash and all the toxic chemicals that come with both can seep into even well-sealed homes and pose risks to health.

“There’s a lot that has potentially happened to affect poor air quality in your home, even if you haven’t suffered any physical damage to the home itself,” said Katherine Pruitt, national senior director for policy at the American Lung Association. “The fumes and the ash, the particles that are going to be in your indoor environment, are not safe to breathe. You especially don’t want to come into contact with the ash in your lungs, eyes or skin.”

Los Angeles Public Health has declared a local health emergency for the entire county due to the fires. It prohibits the use of air blowers, including leaf blowers, in order to reduce health risks due to the ash and particulate matter from smoke.

urned cars and structures can release toxic chemicals. Even after fires die down and smoke dissipates, walls, floors, furniture and other indoor surfaces may absorb toxic chemicals and smoke. These surfaces can off-gas for weeks or even months, studies show, although that will reduce over time.

Wildfires contribute to harmful fine particle pollution, which is at levels bad for human health in the area even before the wildfires. The American Lung Association’s State of the Air report for 2024 listed the Los Angeles area as one of the top 10 cities polluted by year-round particle pollution. It’s been No. 1 for ozone pollution for decades, Pruitt said.

With the wildfires now on top of that, the air quality index has been sitting at “unhealthy” levels for many parts of Southern California for several days.

Symptoms to watch for
Toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest that particle pollution from wildfires is more harmful to the respiratory system than equal doses of particle pollution from other causes.

Exposure to particle pollution can make the eyes burn and the nose run, and it can embed deep in the lungs, leading to breathing problems such as bronchitis. The minuscule particles can also get into the bloodstream and cause inflammation, aggravating diabetes, chronic heart disease and other health conditions.

A 2024 study of the Marshall Fire in the Boulder, Colorado, area showed that bad air hung around inside homes even after the smoke had cleared. Researchers found elevated levels of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ash, in addition to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air samples inside people’s homes.

VOCs can be toxic to humans, and at least one VOC, benzene, is known to cause cancer. Exposure to PAHs is also associated with increased cancer incidence, according to the World Health Organization.

When researchers in the Boulder study surveyed nearby residents, they reported symptoms related to the smoke and ash including headaches, coughing, sneezing, sore throat and watery eyes even six months after the 2021 fire. Those who lived closer to burned-out buildings reported more symptoms.

The number of people reporting symptoms declined a year after the fire, but even two years out, about a third of those surveyed reported at least one smoke- and ash-related symptom.

How to stay safe during cleanup
There are some ways to reduce exposure to these harmful substances if you’re in an area affected by wildfires. The US Environmental Protection Agency recommends checking HVAC filters every few days and changing them if they look dirty. A clean filter is much more effective at protecting inside air.

People who have HVAC systems that use a high-efficiency filter (MERV-13 or higher) should run the system’s fan as often as possible by putting the fan to “On” rather than the “Auto” setting.

Portable air cleaners can help, too. Those with HEPA filters and charcoal filters work best, Pruitt said. The EPA suggests putting air cleaners in rooms where people spend the most time and running them as often as possible on the highest fan speed until any smells go away.

The EPA also suggests limiting activities that can create even more fine particle pollution, such as frying or broiling food. Avoid vacuuming unless the vacuum has a HEPA filter, and don’t smoke or vape indoors.

Although there may be a lingering smell from the wildfire, don’t burn candles or incense inside, which just creates more particle pollution. And soap and water are best for cleaning, rather than aerosols or chemical cleaners that may interact with some of the chemicals in ash.

Don’t try to clean with a traditional vacuum or broom, which will just push the tiny particles into the air. If you’re using a vacuum with a HEPA filter, start by misting surfaces with water to keep ash from floating around.

When cleaning, wear gloves, goggles, long sleeves and long pants and socks to protect skin, and use a N95 or a P100 respirator mask to keep from breathing in ash. “Not a surgical mask. Not a cloth mask. Those aren’t good enough to keep out those very fine particles and some of the gases that you might need to worry about,” Pruitt said.

Ash should be washed off skin as quickly as possible. Before leaving a cleanup site, change clothes so ash doesn’t get tracked into the car or into other locations.

People who have heart or lung diseases like asthma or COPD, the elderly, children and pregnant people should all avoid ash cleanup work because particle pollution is particularly hard on their systems. Older and younger bodies have a harder time expelling pollution from their lungs.

Pets should be kept out of the ash since they are also more susceptible to getting sick. Wash their paws if they do walk through it.

And no matter how quickly you’re trying to clean, Pruitt said, it’s good to take fresh air breaks frequently.

“Hopefully, the outdoor air will have cleared up and you can open up the house and start to air it out,” she said. “If the outdoor air is still smoky, create a clean room with an air cleaner so you can go in there and take a break. And if you experience any symptoms like breathing problems or pain or discomfort, stop cleaning and check with your health care provider before you continue.”"
