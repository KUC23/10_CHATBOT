Hopes rise for Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal,https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire-deal-talks-01-14-25-intl/index.html,"• Talks to finalize any remaining issues related to a Gaza ceasefire and hostages deal are taking place in Doha today. Also today, some of the hostages’ families have been invited to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. • Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages during the first phase of an emerging ceasefire agreement, two Israeli officials said, the first positive sign in months that a truce in the Israel-Hamas war may be in sight. • The release of the hostages would be the first phase of the deal being finalized. Negotiations to reach the second phase – which is intended to end the war – would begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal. Here’s what we know about the potential deal. Talks with Israel to reach a ceasefire-hostage agreement in Gaza have reached their “final stages,” Hamas said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that it hoped the latest round of negotiations will conclude with “a clear and comprehensive agreement.” Hamas also said it had informed Palestinian factions about the progress made talks and that the leaders of the factions were satisfied with the developments. “The leadership of the movement and the various factions emphasized the continuation of communication and consultation,” Hamas said. Hamas and Israel are at the closest point to a ceasefire-hostage agreement than they have been for months, according to Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari on Tuesday. Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas are ongoing in the Qatari capital Doha to finalize the details for a ceasefire-hostage deal in Gaza, Al Ansari said in a news conference. Al Ansari added that a draft of the agreement has been presented to both sides, and that discussions are taking place to solve “simple issues,” mostly related to the implementation mechanisms. The agreement wouldn’t be immediately implemented, he said, adding that it would come “shortly after” the parties reach an agreement. Some sticking points remain in the negotiations, including Hamas’ demands that Israel withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land along the Egypt-Gaza border, and commits to a permanent ceasefire rather than a temporary halt to the military operations launched in the wake of the Hamas October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. The spokesperson said representatives from both the outgoing Biden administration and incoming Trump administration in the United States are also “working very closely” to help reach a deal in Doha. Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir has urged a fellow far-right minister to join him in threatening to collapse the Israeli government over the emerging ceasefire-hostage deal with Hamas. Ben Gvir called on Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to join him in telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that they will resign from government because the potential deal “is horrible.” Netanyahu needs the support of both ministers’ parties in parliament to keep his coalition from collapsing. The minister said his resignation alone would not force Netanyahu to reconsider signing the Gaza deal – which is currently in its final stages of a negotiation – but along with Smotrich, they can form a “strong enough force making it impossible” for Netanyahu to proceed. Despite calling the potential agreement a “catastrophe” for Israel’s national security, Smotrich has not threatened to resign from government. The two far-right ministers were allies before they fell out over police funding. On October 7, 2023, 251 people were kidnapped when Hamas attacked Israel. Israel said that 94 hostages were still in Gaza and another 157 had been returned. Of those still held since October 7, 81 are men and 13 women. There are two children under the age of five. And 84 hostages are from Israel, eight from Thailand, one from Nepal, and another from Tanzania. Israel believes that most of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of a potential deal are alive, a senior Israeli official said, but the bodies of dead captives will also likely be among those released. Correction: This post has been update﻿d to clarify the number of hostages returned from Gaza. If a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is agreed upon, it will go first for approval by the Israeli Security Cabinet and then to the Full Cabinet. Only a simple majority is needed, so there can be abstentions. Once the names of Palestinian prisoners are released, the Supreme Court will accept petitions for 48 hours. Protesters formed a human chain outside the Israeli parliament, also known as the Knesset, on Tuesday to demand the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, as new signs emerge that Israel and Hamas could be moving closer to a ceasefire deal. Many of those gathered held large banners with the names and faces of the captives alongside the words “DON’T leave me behind!” And “everyone is a humanitarian case! No one should be left behind!” The protest comes the same day that negotiators are due to meet in the Qatari capital Doha in the hopes of finalizing a ceasefire deal that would see the release of some of the hostages. Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages during the first phase of the emerging deal. Negotiations to reach the second phase – which is intended to end the war – would begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal. One demonstrator, Shay Dickmann, said a family member held in Gaza had been released in a previous ceasefire and hostage deal in November 2023, while another - her cousin - had been killed while in Hamas captivity in the enclave. “From my family, I know how it is when someone comes back alive on a deal,” she said. “We are not going to let go for any one of them. We want them all back home. And it sounds like there is a chance right now, but we can’t let it go until we see them stepping here in Israel,” she added. Asked if she had a message for the negotiators working on an agreement, Dickmann implored them to keep working until all the hostages were released. “We trust you to make it happen this time. We need your help. And right now it sounds like you’re the key,” she said. Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages during the first phase of an emerging ceasefire agreement being finalized by negotiators in Doha, two Israeli officials said, the first positive sign in months that a truce in the Israel-Hamas war may be in sight. Officials have expressed cautious optimism that a deal could soon be announced to halt 15 months of fighting that has destabilized the Middle East and devastated Gaza, allow for more aid into the besieged Palestinian enclave, and ensure the return of dozens of hostages held by Hamas since its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Hamas and its allies still hold 94 of the 251 hostages taken from Israel, including at least 34 of whom are dead, according to the Israeli government. Israel believes that most of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the deal are alive, a senior Israeli official told reporters on Monday, but the bodies of dead captives will also likely be among those released. The first phase would take place over an initial 42-day ceasefire. The senior Israeli official said the parties appear to be on the verge of an agreement and that Israel is prepared to immediately implement the deal once it has been inked. US President Joe Biden expressed similar optimism in a speech Monday focused on foreign policy, saying the United States was “pressing hard to close this.” President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that his understanding is “there’s been a handshake and they’re getting it finished” when asked about a potential hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier on Monday that the administration was inching closer to a potential hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza and that he believed it could be done this week. Trump’s incoming special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff told reporters last week he was working alongside Biden administration officials during peace talks between Israel and Hamas and hoped to get a temporary 42-day ceasefire deal enacted before Trump’s inauguration. Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has met with two representatives from the United States to review the “the latest developments in the ceasefire negotiations” for Gaza, the Emir’s office said Monday. Al Thani met President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, as well as President Joe Biden’s Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk. The pair have been working together in recent days with mediators to try to resolve some of the last sticking points to a ceasefire deal, sources told CNN. Qatar’s Emir talked with Biden on Monday about joint mediation efforts to end the Israel-Hamas war, the Emir’s administrative office said. He also received a Hamas delegation to review the latest developments, his office said. During the meeting with Hamas, Al Thani “reiterated the state of Qatar’s firm position on the justice of the Palestinian cause, the legitimate rights of the brotherly Palestinian people, and the establishment of their independent state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital,” his office said. A final round of talks in Doha has been scheduled for Tuesday to finalize any remaining issues related to the Gaza ceasefire deal, a diplomat close to the talks told CNN. US President Joe Biden’s Middle East envoy, Brett McGurk, and President-elect Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, have been in Doha. The head of Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad, and the head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency were also present. A source familiar with the Gaza ceasefire-hostage talks that appear close to a breakthrough told CNN that US President-elect Donald Trump is the incentive for Israel to strike a deal with Hamas. “Trump. Only Trump is the incentive. Only Trump,” the source said, adding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “wants to remain close to Trump.” Even if there is no deal by January 20, when Trump will be sworn in as president, then “we have to get to a framework” by that date, the source said."
Pope Francis tells in memoir how documents on abuse and corruption cases were handed to him,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/europe/pope-francis-autobiography-personal-failings-intl/index.html,"One of Pope Francis’ lasting reforms will be his reshaping of the papacy to embrace simplicity and humility, as seen in his decisions to live in a Vatican guesthouse and carry his own briefcase onto the papal plane. With the release of a new autobiography Tuesday, titled “Hope,” Francis underlines this shift with a remarkable openness about his past mistakes and wrongdoings. They include as a young man getting into a fight with a fellow student who “even lost his senses” after hitting his head when thrown to the ground, and insisting that he still commits “errors and sins” today. For a pope, who Catholic theology holds is “infallible” when teaching on faith and morals, it is even more striking. “I feel I have a reputation I do not deserve, a public esteem of which I am not worthy,” writes Francis, who was recently awarded the highest civilian honor in the United States by President Joe Biden. “This, beyond doubt, is my strongest sentiment.” While the memoir covers major events in the Francis papacy, including the revelation that he faced two assassination attempts during his 2021 visit to Iraq, it does not offer many new details about the scandals and controversies he’s had to address during his pontificate and the significant opposition he’s encountered from some church quarters. On the Catholic Church’s sexual abuse scandal, the pope says he has felt “called to take responsibility for all the evil committed by certain priests.” Francis explained that as he began his pontificate in 2013, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI gave him a large white box filled with documents “relating to the most difficult and painful situations: cases of abuse, corruption, dark dealings, wrongdoings.” The pope recalls that when he was handed the box, his predecessor said “everything is in here” and that “now it’s your turn” to deal with the problems. The 88-year-old pontiff also uses the memoir to address the crises facing today’s world. Describing himself as having always been “politically restless,” he repeatedly condemns the evils of war, while linking the rise of populism today to that of the 1930s and Hitler’s Germany. (Francis was born in 1936 and recalls his grandmother standing up to Mussolini’s black shirts.) Young people, he writes, need to know “how a distorted populism is born and grows,” recalling the “German federal elections of 1932–33 and Adolf Hitler, the ex-infantryman obsessed by the defeat of World War I and about ‘racial purity,’ who had promised the growth of Germany in the wake of a government that had failed.” The plight of refugees, for whom Francis has been a tireless advocate, is also personal. His paternal grandparents and father had planned to sail in 1927 on the Principessa Mafalda from Italy to Argentina, which sank with the loss of many lives, but ended up making a later crossing. It has made Francis sensitive to the dangers faced by today’s migrants, and he criticizes those countries which produce weapons but then “refuse and turn away the refugees who have been generated by those weapons and by those conflicts.” Francis’ earthy humility can be traced back to his upbringing. In the memoir, the first Latin American pontiff recalls growing up in the Flores barrio in Buenos Aires, depicting a joyful, varied and close-knit community with people from different faiths but a place where he also saw the “darker and more difficult side of existence,” such as the “prison world” and prostitution. Later, as a bishop in the Argentine capital, he ministered to prostitutes and recalls how he gave the last rites to one sex worker from his childhood neighbourhood, La Porota, saying that “even now, I don’t forget to pray for her on the day of her death.” Francis’ awareness of human struggles, and his own failings, has made him insist time and again on the importance of God’s mercy. And throughout his pontificate, he has made efforts to welcome LGBTQ+ people, re-iterating in his memoir that God “loves them (gay people) as they are” and describing a group of transgender women who met him in the Vatican as “daughters of God!” The new autobiography underlines that Francis remains a pope who has a voice that can connect with people beyond the institution of the Catholic Church. The memoir was written over six years in collaboration with Carlo Musso, from Italian publisher Mondadori, and is being released in major languages in over 80 countries. It follows the publication of another Francis memoir, “Life,” last year. “Hope” was originally due to be published after the pontiff’s death but its release has been brought forward to coincide with the Catholic Church’s jubilee year. As for the future, the pope says he has not considered resigning, even though it is a “possibility,” and he addresses some of his health difficulties in recent years. Francis says that he is currently in good health and has physiotherapy twice a week, but the “reality is, quite simply, that I am old.” He expected to be elected pope, he says, but since that moment has revealed a determination to remain grounded. He explains how he shunned the papal apartments in the isolated Vatican’s apostolic palace for the Casa Santa Marta guesthouse because he “cannot live without people around me” and insists on the importance of keeping a sense of humor. That is also evident in the memoir – for instance, when the pope explains how he was told to wear white trousers, rather than black, to go under his new white papal cassock. “They made me laugh. I don’t want to be an ice cream seller, I said. And I kept my own,” the pope writes."
"Hamas expected to release 33 hostages in first phase of emerging ceasefire deal, Israeli officials say",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/middleeast/hamas-33-hostages-israel-ceasefire-talks-intl-latam/index.html,"Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages during the first phase of an emerging ceasefire agreement being finalized by negotiators in Doha, two Israeli officials said, the first positive sign in months that a truce in the Israel-Hamas war may be in sight. Officials have expressed cautious optimism that a deal could soon be announced to halt 15 months of fighting that has destabilized the Middle East and devastated Gaza, allow for more aid into the besieged Palestinian enclave, and ensure the return of dozens of hostages held by Hamas since its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Hamas and its allies still hold 94 of the 251 hostages taken from Israel, including at least 34 of whom are dead, according to the Israeli government. Israel believes that most of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the deal are alive, a senior Israeli official told reporters on Monday, but the bodies of dead captives will also likely be among those released. The first phase would take place over an initial 42-day ceasefire. The senior Israeli official said the parties appear to be on the verge of an agreement and that Israel is prepared to immediately implement the deal once it has been inked. US President Joe Biden expressed similar optimism in a speech Monday focused on foreign policy, saying the United States was “pressing hard to close this.” “The deal we have structured would free the hostages, halt the fighting, provide security to Israel, and allow us to significantly surge humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians who suffered terribly in this war that Hamas started. They have been through hell,” Biden said. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump told Newsmax that his understanding is that “there’s been a handshake and they’re getting it finished.” Trump’s incoming special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff previously told reporters he was working alongside Biden administration officials during the negotiations, and hoped to get a temporary ceasefire deal enacted before Trump’s inauguration on Monday. A diplomat close to the negotiations told CNN a final round of proximity talks to finalize any issues was scheduled to take place in Doha on Tuesday. The same day, some of the hostages’ families have been invited to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. On Tuesday, protesters formed a human chain outside the Israeli parliament, also known as the Knesset, to demand the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza. Many held large banners with the names and faces of the captives alongside the words “DON’T leave me behind!” One demonstrator, Shay Dickmann, said a family member held in Gaza had been released in a previous ceasefire and hostage deal in November 2023, while another — her cousin — had been killed while in Hamas captivity in the enclave. “From my family, I know how it is when someone comes back alive on a deal,” she said. “We are not going to let go for any one of them. We want them all back home. And it sounds like there is a chance right now, but we can’t let it go until we see them stepping here in Israel.” Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees, told CNN on Monday that he was traveling to Doha to advise negotiators on the list of detainees to be released “in the event the deal materializes.” The release of the 33 hostages would be the first phase of the deal being finalized. Negotiations to reach the second phase – which is intended to end the war – would begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal. Under the latest proposals, Israeli forces would maintain a presence along the Philadelphi Corridor – a narrow strip of land along the Egypt-Gaza border – during the first phase of the agreement, the officials said. The presence of Israeli troops along the corridor previously contributed to sinking a potential deal in September during the last round of negotiations. Israel would also maintain a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border with Israel, the official said, without specifying how wide that zone would be – another subject of contention during the negotiations. A Hamas official told CNN earlier that the group wanted the buffer zone to return to the pre-October 7 size of 300-500 meters (330-545 yards) from the border line, while Israel was requesting 2,000 meters. The residents of northern Gaza would be allowed to return freely to the north of the strip, but an Israeli official claimed there would be unspecified “security arrangements” in place. Palestinian prisoners deemed responsible for killing Israelis would not be released into the West Bank, the official said, but rather to the Gaza Strip or abroad following agreements with foreign countries. CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment. A senior Israeli official told reporters on Monday that a “breakthrough” in the talks came late Sunday night during Israeli intelligence agency Mossad Director David Barnea’s meeting with the mediators in Doha, Qatar. “There is talk of an agreement in the near future – it is impossible to say whether it is a matter of hours or days,” the official said. The official said Israel is prepared to quickly implement the agreement, but the deal must first pass both the security cabinet and full government cabinet. The government must also allow time for opponents of the agreement to petition the Supreme Court. “We are closer than ever to a deal but mediators in Doha are still awaiting official responses from both sides,” said an Arab official briefed on the talks. Speaking to CNN Monday, the former Israeli intelligence official Avi Melamed cautioned that even if a deal were reached, the continued presence of the Israeli military and Hamas in Gaza during the first phase of its implementation could risk reigniting hostilities. “That part is very sensitive because it could potentially have the seeds that result in – at some point for whatever the reason – reignition or flares of fighting in Gaza. It’s not to say necessarily that that will happen, but it’s something that could happen and we should take it into consideration,” he said. Melamed said that during the first phase of a deal, neither side would want to give up leverage but in the next phase would try to exhaust “any kind of leverage cards they have” including in the context of military capacities in Gaza. Meanwhile, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Monday it remained hopeful but cautious amid the reports of a deal being close. “We continue to trust in those working tirelessly to bring our loved ones home, and we will not rest until the last hostage returns,” the group said. Israel launched its war on Hamas in Gaza following the attacks of October 7, 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. Since then, the Israeli military has killed at least 46,565 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. More than 100,000 have been injured.

"In a minefield of glitchy AI search and social media, Wikipedia becomes one of the most reliable places on the internet",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/business/wikipedia-meta-x-fact-check-nightcap/index.html?utm_source=business_ribbon,"How old was Marlon Brando in “The Godfather?” That was the fairly straightforward question my husband typed into Google while the movie played in the background over our Thanksgiving break. The answer from Google’s AI overview: “Marlon Brando was not yet old enough to act in The Godfather when he died in 2004 at the age of 80.” It was one of the funnier, somewhat surprising screw-ups we’d seen from Gemini, which like all publicly available artificial intelligence tools is prone to what the tech industry calls “hallucinations.” He screenshot the answer so that we could have a laugh about it, and then scrolled down to find the first non-sponsored, non-AI search result: an entry from one of the most reliable places on the internet, Wikipedia. If I’d written that last sentence at the start of my career, no editor would have allowed it into print. You can’t trust something that anyone can edit, the thinking went, and so it became a bad word in journalism and academia. Don’t cite it; don’t even look at it. Or if you do, for God’s sake, don’t let anyone see you. But over the past two decades, the free-to-use online encyclopedia has carried on with its mission, expanding its global community of volunteer editors, known as Wikipedians, and ultimately resisting the kinds of platform decay that have claimed other 2000s-era internet phenoms like Facebook, Twitter and, to some extent, Google. (In a statement to Nightcap, Google said it maintains a “high quality bar with all Search features” and that its extensive testing found “people find their results more helpful with AI Overviews.” Meta and X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.) What’s emerged is a port in a storm of misinformation, and a potential roadmap for startups as Big Tech continues to abdicate any responsibility for the garbage littering its platforms in the form of AI-generated slop and human-generated propaganda. (By the way, Brando was 47 at the time he filmed “The Godfather” and turned 48 shortly after its release in 1972, according to Wikipedia and multiple obituaries.) Wikipedia is the seventh most popular website on the planet, according to analytics firm Similarweb — after Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, X and WhatsApp. It is the only one on that list not owned by Alphabet, Meta or Elon Musk (who has recently taken aim at what he called “Wokepedia,” for what he and the MAGA right views as liberal bias). The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation hosts Wikipedia, generating the bulk of its financing through small donations and grants. That’s part of the secret to its success, according to Molly White, a researcher and prolific Wikipedia editor. With Wikipedia, “there isn’t some huge corporation enriching themselves off the backs of the free editing” White told me. “Whereas over on Twitter, your free labor is going toward a corporation that is directly enriching Elon Musk.” Musk promptly fired Twitter’s trust and safety team when he bought Twitter, now called X, in 2022. The site now relies on users to fact-check one another through a “community notes” system that has done little to counter false information, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate. X users who’ve stepped up to try to debunk lies and flag propaganda recently told the Washington Post that their efforts often feel like a game of whack-a-mole. That’s the same system that Mark Zuckerberg revealed last week for Meta, which is preparing to fire its third-party professional fact-checkers who are already straining against a flood of conspiracy theories. By Zuckerberg’s own admission, that move is a “trade-off” that will mean allowing more “bad stuff” on the platforms. Wikipedia’s crowdsourcing model isn’t perfect — the site has an entry on its own reliability in which it acknowledges instances of vandalism, and it keeps a list of hoaxes that have taken off there. Still, as a general rule, you’re not going to find Marlon Brando’s Wikipedia entry not suggest that he wasn’t in “The Godfather.” When someone tries to insert bad intel into a Wikipedia page, that edit gets flagged to hundreds or thousands of Wikipedians around the world who keep tabs on various pages. (More than 280,000 editors contribute to Wikimedia projects every month, according to the organization.) I asked White why the community notes model, which on paper seems in line with the Wikipedia ethos, doesn’t seem to be working so well on X. “I think that people who are writing community notes are very much in a reactive frame of mind, where it’s not about providing high-quality information — it’s about preventing some of the most egregious misinformation from proliferating.” With Wikipedia, she added, there’s a baseline level of behavior that the community of editors reinforces. “People who are trolling or expressing their own political beliefs are not tolerated on the site.” (No wonder Musk dislikes it.) Bottom line: The internet’s most popular sites are in a state of transition. X and Meta are doing away with guardrails. Google is forcing unreliable AI to the top of its search results. Meanwhile, TikTok is facing a ban in the US and lawmakers are forcing Pornhub to block its content in roughly a third of US states. Wikipedia’s stodgy nonprofit model suddenly looks a lot more appealing. Its community-focused approach to moderation is also taking off with platforms like Bluesky, which has reportedly surged past 21 million users amid an exodus from X. “This idea of a social network with the benevolent dictator… isn’t a particularly sustainable thing,” White said. “It works until that benevolent dictator either sells the platform or has a political 180 of his own.”"
"Soon to be out of a job, Meta’s fact-checkers battle a blaze of wildfire conspiracy theories",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/tech/meta-fact-checkers-wildfire-conspiracy-theories/index.html?utm_source=business_ribbon,"Just hours after Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg announced last Tuesday that the social media giant would eliminate its US-based fact-checkers, the iconic hills above Los Angeles began to smolder. As fire crews scrambled in vain to contain the resulting firestorm, the fact-checking partners, still working for Meta, took on their own fight: trying to slow viral misinformation rapidly spreading around the wildfires. Rumor and speculation about the disaster began to swirl online like glowing embers, before eventually becoming a wild blaze of vast conspiracy theories. “Cutting fact checkers from social platforms is like disbanding your fire department,” said Alan Duke, a former CNN journalist who co-founded the fact-checking outlet Lead Stories, one of dozens of such organizations around the world funded by Meta. Meta has not announced when it will formally end its fact-checking program, but a person familiar with the program said it could be eliminated as soon as March. The decision will force some of Meta’s fact-checking partners to lay off staff or shut down once the company’s financial support dries up. Duke, a Los Angeles resident, could see the orange glow of the fires from his home as he and his colleagues at Lead Stories worked to tackle conspiracy theories about the blazes that have left at least two dozen people dead. “Fires and looting. A regular Democrat run city,” read the caption on an Instagram video showing men removing a television from a home amid the fires. After Lead Stories fact-checked the claim and found that the men were not looters, but in fact the resident’s family helping save their belongings, Meta placed a fact-check label on the video. When a post is labeled as false or misleading, Meta says it applies penalties that “significantly reduce that content’s distribution so that fewer people see” it and also notifies users who try to share the post. PolitiFact, the Florida-based Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-check organization that also is part of Meta’s program, debunked a viral post on Threads falsely claiming Los Angeles police were “looking for three ‘persons of interest’ all tied to a MAGA website who were spotted at the source of all three major LA fire.” PolitiFact also debunked an image circulating on Instagram that purported to show the iconic Hollywood sign on fire. PolitiFact said the false image was likely created using artificial intelligence. Much of the misinformation swirling online was of a distinctively partisan nature and spread beyond Meta’s platforms by some of the most widely followed and influential figures on the internet. False claims promoted by President-elect Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform sought to blame the Democratic Party for the wildfires. On X, Elon Musk downplayed the role of climate change while repeatedly blaming diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies for the fires. “DEI means people will DIE,” Musk posted. The disgraced conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed on X that the fires were “part of a larger globalist plot to wage economic warfare and deindustrialize the United States before trigger total collapse.” “True,” Musk wrote in a response to Jones. Like the devastating Maui wildfires in 2023 and Hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024, conspiracy theorists claimed the Los Angeles fires had been deliberately set by the government. Some baselessly suggested the government was controlling the weather and directing strong winds to spread the fires. “The false claims we are seeing on the wildfires are similar to what happened with the recent hurricane that slammed the southeast a few months ago. It creates distrust of emergency agencies that are actively responding to the disaster, making it more difficult for them during the crisis,” Duke told CNN. “The same thing happened after the Maui fires in 2023,” he added. “Space lasers were blamed. It was allegedly a conspiracy to steal the land. Unless the false claims are countered with facts collected and assessed by professionals, the myths and distrust will continue to spread.” But removing professional fact-checkers from the equation is precisely what Zuckerberg intends to do. In his announcement last Tuesday, the billionaire said he planned to replace the fact-checking program that was created in the wake of Trump’s 2016 election with something similar to X’s Community Notes feature. Community Notes is a crowd-sourced form of fact-checking where the platform’s users can append notes to debunk or provide further context to posts. Community Notes only appear on posts when X users with “diverse perspectives” agree a post warrants one, the Musk-owned company outlines in a somewhat obscure explanation on its website. “Community Notes doesn’t work by majority rules. To identify notes that are helpful to a wide range of people, notes require agreement between contributors who have sometimes disagreed in their past ratings. This helps prevent one-sided ratings,” the company says. Unlike fact-checking journalists, however, community users are not bound by ethical guidelines to provide fair and accurate assessments. Fact checks in the form of Community Notes have been added to posts on X, including on a video with more than 500,000 views that falsely purported to show the fire approaching the Hollywood sign (An assessment by Lead Stories found the video was likely created using artificial intelligence). Another Community Note offered a robust fact-check of a post from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene about the fire that played into conspiracy theories about the government’s ability to control the weather. But other posts baselessly suggesting the fires had been planned by the government, started using lasers, and spread through weather manipulation have gone unchecked on X. Alex Jones’ baseless claim that the fires are part of a “globalist plot” has not been marked with a Community Note and as of Sunday had been viewed more than 17 million times. Angie Drobnic Holan, the director of the International Fact-Checking Network, whose members are part of the Meta fact-checking program, told CNN that while Community Notes has had some success, it is no substitute for professional fact-checks. “Professional fact-checkers can tackle a wider variety of complex conspiracy theories and political claims, while community-based systems excel mainly at flagging obvious visual misattribution,” Holan said."
Trump is on a collision course with the bond vigilantes,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/business/trump-market-debt/index.html?utm_source=business_ribbon,"In early 1993, President Bill Clinton looked to push through the economic stimulus package he had touted on the campaign trail. But those promises were stopped dead in their tracks by a formidable opponent: the bond market. Clinton was forced to abandon much of the economic plan and shift focus to fixing the budget rather than risk skyrocketing interest rates that would tank the economy. That episode demonstrated the power of the bond market to check policies that investors disagree with –– even ones championed by a president emboldened by a political triumph. Clinton political adviser James Carville famously said at the time: “I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the Pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.” The bond market can be so intimidating that in the 1980s, economist Ed Yardeni dubbed these outraged investors the “bond vigilantes” for their role in preserving law and order in capital markets if government officials won’t. Now there is a risk of another collision between those bond vigilantes and a newly elected president. Even before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, the bond market is already flexing its muscles. Yields have surged to uncomfortably high levels due to a fusion of factors that includes concerns about high budget deficits and the risk that Trump’s tariffs, tax cuts and deportations will reignite inflation. “We are in a déjà vu moment,” Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, told CNN in a phone interview. “Trump didn’t automatically win the vote of the bond vigilantes. He’s got to earn their respect.” If he doesn’t, the bond market could act as a brake on Trump’s policies. And that would be painful, especially for a president who views the stock market as a real-time barometer of his success. After Friday’s blockbuster jobs report, the bond market sold off again. That pushed 10-year US Treasury rates closer to the 5% level that many view as a dangerous red line. The higher rates climb, the more pressure they will put on stocks. After all, if ultra-safe government debt is returning 5%, expensive tech stocks look like less of a sure bet by comparison. Not only that, a possible bond market selloff would make it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow, pushing up rates on mortgages and other debt. That would undermine Trump’s promise to slash Americans’ cost of living. Higher Treasury rates, by definition, would also make it more expensive for the federal government to finance its mountain of debt. That’s a problem because interest is already swallowing up a greater chunk of the annual federal budget than defense spending. “Bond vigilantes haven’t been heard from for quite some time. But they’ve only become more powerful,” said Yardeni, noting that America’s growing debt makes the budget more sensitive to even modest shifts in rates. And higher rates could force the Federal Reserve’s hand, prompting officials to raise their benchmark short-term rates to prevent the economy from overheating. “That’s a nightmare on top of a nightmare,” said Yardeni. It’s important to note that Trump is inheriting a very different economy this time around. When Trump won in 2016, the economic recovery from the Great Recession was frustratingly mediocre. Interest rates were still extremely low. And central bankers were worried that inflation was too low. Now, the economy is running hot, with gross domestic product, job growth and inflation all surprising to the upside. Mainstream economists have warned that the Trump agenda could be inflationary, perhaps very inflationary. Not only that, but deficits are much higher now. “Trump 1.0 and Biden boxed the incoming administration in,” Yardeni said, “because the bond market will keep them from being able to run reckless deficit policies.” Some on Wall Street are worried that if policymakers aren’t careful, the United States could face its own “Liz Truss moment.” In 2022, bond investors rebelled against the budget proposals from British Prime Minister Liz Truss. It was such a disaster that Truss was forced to step down, becoming the UK’s shortest-serving prime minister. Scott Bessent, Trump’s nominee for Treasury secretary, is well aware of the bond vigilantes. Bessent, a widely respected investor with deep experience in markets, expressed confidence that Trump can slash the budget deficit. “Bessent is a prince of those bond vigilantes. Now he’s in the catbird seat as Treasury secretary. He knows how to play chess against those other players in the market,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. But it won’t be easy to slash the deficit, especially because there isn’t much room to cut spending. Much of the federal budget is tied up in paying interest, defense spending and social safety net programs that are politically popular. Even Elon Musk has walked back his previous promise to slash $2 trillion from the federal budget, a figure that many experts have panned as unrealistic. There remains significant uncertainty over tariffs, including when they may get imposed, how high they will climb and how long they will be in place. Tariffs could raise revenue but could also ding growth. “Tariffs are a double-edged sword. They could raise revenue, but they can be damaging to growth because they elicit retaliation from other countries,” said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and a former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Joe Biden. Another major question is whether Trump will go beyond extending the expiring 2017 tax law by enacting new tax cuts. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to end taxes on overtime, tips and Social Security benefits and to enact other breaks. Trump also promised to address complaints about the $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions that were part of the 2017 law. The SALT cap hurt upper-middle-class Americans in high-tax states. Tedeschi said Republican efforts to lift the SALT cap and enact other tax breaks could provoke a response from bond investors already worried about the deficit. “Bond traders personally would love lifting the SALT cap. But it would be extremely expensive and worsen our fiscal trajectory,” he said. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, agreed that investors are concerned about adding to the deficit unless it speeds up longer-term growth. “You can’t add that much stimulus at this point because inflation is high and the deficit is high,” Shah said. Yardeni is hopeful the presence of the bond vigilantes, and Trump’s focus on the stock market, will act as powerful vetoes over risky policies, preventing them from becoming a reality. “If yields spike, the stock market could go down and the administration will respond quickly because Trump views the stock market as his daily popular vote,” Yardeni said. “That’s the power of the bond vigilantes.”"
"In a minefield of glitchy AI search and social media, Wikipedia becomes one of the most reliable places on the internet",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/business/wikipedia-meta-x-fact-check-nightcap/index.html,"How old was Marlon Brando in “The Godfather?” That was the fairly straightforward question my husband typed into Google while the movie played in the background over our Thanksgiving break. The answer from Google’s AI overview: “Marlon Brando was not yet old enough to act in The Godfather when he died in 2004 at the age of 80.” It was one of the funnier, somewhat surprising screw-ups we’d seen from Gemini, which like all publicly available artificial intelligence tools is prone to what the tech industry calls “hallucinations.” He screenshot the answer so that we could have a laugh about it, and then scrolled down to find the first non-sponsored, non-AI search result: an entry from one of the most reliable places on the internet, Wikipedia. If I’d written that last sentence at the start of my career, no editor would have allowed it into print. You can’t trust something that anyone can edit, the thinking went, and so it became a bad word in journalism and academia. Don’t cite it; don’t even look at it. Or if you do, for God’s sake, don’t let anyone see you. But over the past two decades, the free-to-use online encyclopedia has carried on with its mission, expanding its global community of volunteer editors, known as Wikipedians, and ultimately resisting the kinds of platform decay that have claimed other 2000s-era internet phenoms like Facebook, Twitter and, to some extent, Google. (In a statement to Nightcap, Google said it maintains a “high quality bar with all Search features” and that its extensive testing found “people find their results more helpful with AI Overviews.” Meta and X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.) What’s emerged is a port in a storm of misinformation, and a potential roadmap for startups as Big Tech continues to abdicate any responsibility for the garbage littering its platforms in the form of AI-generated slop and human-generated propaganda. (By the way, Brando was 47 at the time he filmed “The Godfather” and turned 48 shortly after its release in 1972, according to Wikipedia and multiple obituaries.) Wikipedia is the seventh most popular website on the planet, according to analytics firm Similarweb — after Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, X and WhatsApp. It is the only one on that list not owned by Alphabet, Meta or Elon Musk (who has recently taken aim at what he called “Wokepedia,” for what he and the MAGA right views as liberal bias). The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation hosts Wikipedia, generating the bulk of its financing through small donations and grants. That’s part of the secret to its success, according to Molly White, a researcher and prolific Wikipedia editor. With Wikipedia, “there isn’t some huge corporation enriching themselves off the backs of the free editing” White told me. “Whereas over on Twitter, your free labor is going toward a corporation that is directly enriching Elon Musk.” Musk promptly fired Twitter’s trust and safety team when he bought Twitter, now called X, in 2022. The site now relies on users to fact-check one another through a “community notes” system that has done little to counter false information, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate. X users who’ve stepped up to try to debunk lies and flag propaganda recently told the Washington Post that their efforts often feel like a game of whack-a-mole. That’s the same system that Mark Zuckerberg revealed last week for Meta, which is preparing to fire its third-party professional fact-checkers who are already straining against a flood of conspiracy theories. By Zuckerberg’s own admission, that move is a “trade-off” that will mean allowing more “bad stuff” on the platforms. Wikipedia’s crowdsourcing model isn’t perfect — the site has an entry on its own reliability in which it acknowledges instances of vandalism, and it keeps a list of hoaxes that have taken off there. Still, as a general rule, you’re not going to find Marlon Brando’s Wikipedia entry not suggest that he wasn’t in “The Godfather.” When someone tries to insert bad intel into a Wikipedia page, that edit gets flagged to hundreds or thousands of Wikipedians around the world who keep tabs on various pages. (More than 280,000 editors contribute to Wikimedia projects every month, according to the organization.) I asked White why the community notes model, which on paper seems in line with the Wikipedia ethos, doesn’t seem to be working so well on X. “I think that people who are writing community notes are very much in a reactive frame of mind, where it’s not about providing high-quality information — it’s about preventing some of the most egregious misinformation from proliferating.” With Wikipedia, she added, there’s a baseline level of behavior that the community of editors reinforces. “People who are trolling or expressing their own political beliefs are not tolerated on the site.” (No wonder Musk dislikes it.) Bottom line: The internet’s most popular sites are in a state of transition. X and Meta are doing away with guardrails. Google is forcing unreliable AI to the top of its search results. Meanwhile, TikTok is facing a ban in the US and lawmakers are forcing Pornhub to block its content in roughly a third of US states. Wikipedia’s stodgy nonprofit model suddenly looks a lot more appealing. Its community-focused approach to moderation is also taking off with platforms like Bluesky, which has reportedly surged past 21 million users amid an exodus from X. “This idea of a social network with the benevolent dictator… isn’t a particularly sustainable thing,” White said. “It works until that benevolent dictator either sells the platform or has a political 180 of his own.”"
"Soon to be out of a job, Meta’s fact-checkers battle a blaze of wildfire conspiracy theories",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/tech/meta-fact-checkers-wildfire-conspiracy-theories/index.html,"Just hours after Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg announced last Tuesday that the social media giant would eliminate its US-based fact-checkers, the iconic hills above Los Angeles began to smolder. As fire crews scrambled in vain to contain the resulting firestorm, the fact-checking partners, still working for Meta, took on their own fight: trying to slow viral misinformation rapidly spreading around the wildfires. Rumor and speculation about the disaster began to swirl online like glowing embers, before eventually becoming a wild blaze of vast conspiracy theories. “Cutting fact checkers from social platforms is like disbanding your fire department,” said Alan Duke, a former CNN journalist who co-founded the fact-checking outlet Lead Stories, one of dozens of such organizations around the world funded by Meta. Meta has not announced when it will formally end its fact-checking program, but a person familiar with the program said it could be eliminated as soon as March. The decision will force some of Meta’s fact-checking partners to lay off staff or shut down once the company’s financial support dries up. Duke, a Los Angeles resident, could see the orange glow of the fires from his home as he and his colleagues at Lead Stories worked to tackle conspiracy theories about the blazes that have left at least two dozen people dead. “Fires and looting. A regular Democrat run city,” read the caption on an Instagram video showing men removing a television from a home amid the fires. After Lead Stories fact-checked the claim and found that the men were not looters, but in fact the resident’s family helping save their belongings, Meta placed a fact-check label on the video. When a post is labeled as false or misleading, Meta says it applies penalties that “significantly reduce that content’s distribution so that fewer people see” it and also notifies users who try to share the post. PolitiFact, the Florida-based Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-check organization that also is part of Meta’s program, debunked a viral post on Threads falsely claiming Los Angeles police were “looking for three ‘persons of interest’ all tied to a MAGA website who were spotted at the source of all three major LA fire.” PolitiFact also debunked an image circulating on Instagram that purported to show the iconic Hollywood sign on fire. PolitiFact said the false image was likely created using artificial intelligence. Much of the misinformation swirling online was of a distinctively partisan nature and spread beyond Meta’s platforms by some of the most widely followed and influential figures on the internet. False claims promoted by President-elect Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform sought to blame the Democratic Party for the wildfires. On X, Elon Musk downplayed the role of climate change while repeatedly blaming diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies for the fires. “DEI means people will DIE,” Musk posted. The disgraced conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed on X that the fires were “part of a larger globalist plot to wage economic warfare and deindustrialize the United States before trigger total collapse.” “True,” Musk wrote in a response to Jones. Like the devastating Maui wildfires in 2023 and Hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024, conspiracy theorists claimed the Los Angeles fires had been deliberately set by the government. Some baselessly suggested the government was controlling the weather and directing strong winds to spread the fires. “The false claims we are seeing on the wildfires are similar to what happened with the recent hurricane that slammed the southeast a few months ago. It creates distrust of emergency agencies that are actively responding to the disaster, making it more difficult for them during the crisis,” Duke told CNN. “The same thing happened after the Maui fires in 2023,” he added. “Space lasers were blamed. It was allegedly a conspiracy to steal the land. Unless the false claims are countered with facts collected and assessed by professionals, the myths and distrust will continue to spread.” But removing professional fact-checkers from the equation is precisely what Zuckerberg intends to do. In his announcement last Tuesday, the billionaire said he planned to replace the fact-checking program that was created in the wake of Trump’s 2016 election with something similar to X’s Community Notes feature. Community Notes is a crowd-sourced form of fact-checking where the platform’s users can append notes to debunk or provide further context to posts. Community Notes only appear on posts when X users with “diverse perspectives” agree a post warrants one, the Musk-owned company outlines in a somewhat obscure explanation on its website. “Community Notes doesn’t work by majority rules. To identify notes that are helpful to a wide range of people, notes require agreement between contributors who have sometimes disagreed in their past ratings. This helps prevent one-sided ratings,” the company says. Unlike fact-checking journalists, however, community users are not bound by ethical guidelines to provide fair and accurate assessments. Fact checks in the form of Community Notes have been added to posts on X, including on a video with more than 500,000 views that falsely purported to show the fire approaching the Hollywood sign (An assessment by Lead Stories found the video was likely created using artificial intelligence). Another Community Note offered a robust fact-check of a post from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene about the fire that played into conspiracy theories about the government’s ability to control the weather. But other posts baselessly suggesting the fires had been planned by the government, started using lasers, and spread through weather manipulation have gone unchecked on X. Alex Jones’ baseless claim that the fires are part of a “globalist plot” has not been marked with a Community Note and as of Sunday had been viewed more than 17 million times. Angie Drobnic Holan, the director of the International Fact-Checking Network, whose members are part of the Meta fact-checking program, told CNN that while Community Notes has had some success, it is no substitute for professional fact-checks. “Professional fact-checkers can tackle a wider variety of complex conspiracy theories and political claims, while community-based systems excel mainly at flagging obvious visual misattribution,” Holan said."
The next leg of the new moon race is about to kick off — and it could be the most exciting yet,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/science/lunar-landers-moon-missions-2025/index.html,"The past few years have marked the advent of a new lunar space race, with a fleet of robotic spacecraft from various countries trying — and mostly failing — to reach the moon and carry out their intended missions. But 2025 may offer a second chance for the companies and countries behind those missions that crashed and burned, as well as introduce some new players to the field. January will kick off with the launch of two lunar landers in one fell swoop: A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will carry spacecraft developed by Cedar Park, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and Tokyo-based Ispace. Firefly is making its first attempt to put a vehicle on the moon, but this mission marks a second try for Ispace, after its first lander crashed and blasted a divot in the lunar surface in 2023. And those two landers are only a couple of the uncrewed missions looking to reach the lunar surface — or seek redemption — in the coming months. This year promises to be among the most tantalizing yet in humanity’s renewed push to explore the moon, with the United States and its allies as well as China scrambling to send robots to the lunar surface. Many of these machine-driven missions are designed to pave the way for astronauts to return to the lunar surface, as NASA plans to do as soon as 2027. Here’s a glance at some of the moon shots on the horizon. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket slated to launch landers for both Firefly and Ispace is set to liftoff as soon as 1:11 a.m. ET Wednesday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. If all goes according to plan, Firefly’s lander, called Blue Ghost, will spend about 45 days making a careful approach to its lunar destination around Mons Latreille, an ancient volcanic feature in a more than 300-mile-wide (483-kilometer) basin called Mare Crisium, or the “Sea of Crises,” on the moon’s near side. “Mare Crisium was created by early volcanic eruptions and flooded with basaltic lava more than 3 billion years ago,” according to Firefly. “This unique landing site will allow our payload partners to gather critical data about the Moon’s regolith (rock and dust rubble), geophysical characteristics, and the interaction of solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field.” On board Blue Ghost will be a group of science experiments and technology demonstrations, including ones that will test a “Lunar PlanetVac” to collect and sort soil samples on the moon, satellite navigation, radiation-adapated computers, and self-cleaning glass that can wipe away lunar dust, according to Firefly. For its inaugural mission, Blue Ghost is expected to operate on the moon for about 14 days before its landing zone is plunged into the frigid temperatures of lunar nighttime. Firefly is among the participants in NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program in which the space agency partners with private companies to deliver payloads to the moon. Others contractors include Houston-based Intuitive Machines and Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology. The goal of the CLPS program is to give NASA a pool of commercial robotic landers that can ferry cargo to the lunar surface as the space agency works on separate plans to get its astronauts to the moon later this decade. “It’s a good time for the lunar economy,” Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CNN in December, adding that he’s “100% confident in our team’s ability” to land the company’s Blue Ghost vehicle successfully. Success, of course, is not guaranteed. Ispace, the Japan-based company, understands that all too well: The company’s first attempt to put one of its Hakuto-R landers on the moon ended in a dramatic failure in April 2023 because of navigation issues. Now, an upgraded Hakuto-R spacecraft, named Resilience, will offer Ispace a second chance. The spacecraft will take a much slower path to the moon than Blue Ghost after the landers are deployed from their Falcon 9 rocket. Resilience is aiming to land on the moon roughly four to five months after liftoff, according to Jumpei Nozaki, the Ispace’s chief financial officer. On this mission, the Resillience lander will carry a tiny rover as well as tech instruments with various goals, including testing algae-based food production and monitoring deep-space radiation. Ispace is targeting an area of the moon called Mare Frigoris — or the “Sea of Cold,” which lies in the far northern reaches of the moon’s near side — for its landing location. Houston-based Intuitive Machines made history in February 2024 by putting a US-made lunar lander on the moon for the first time in more than five decades. The triumphant touchdown of the company’s Nova-C lunar lander, called Odysseus, spurred jubilant cheers during the company’s webcast. But the landing wasn’t perfect: Odysseus tipped over on its side because of a navigation issue, leaving the vehicle to run with limited power and capabilities. But Intuitive Machines will soon get another shot at perfection with a new Nova-C lander, called Athena, set to make its way moonward this year. The mission, slated to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, could kick off as soon as late February, the company confirmed Monday. It will aim to land near the moon’s south pole — a region considered crucial to the current moon race because it’s believed to be home to stores of water ice. Water found there could be used to provide astronauts with drinking water or even converted to rocket fuel. Notably, on board Athena will be PRIME-1, or the Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment 1, a NASA-developed tech demo designed to search and drill for water ice. Also sharing a ride with Athena will be NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer, a satellite designed to orbit the moon and use remote sensing to detect water. If both of those NASA payloads succeed, it will be a welcome win for the space agency, which lost at least four research satellites during its November 2022 Artemis I mission. The primary goal of that flight — to send an unoccupied crew capsule on a test flight around the moon — went smoothly. But a group of small NASA satellites deployed alongside the spacecraft, including two meant to hunt for lunar water, failed to hit their marks. Blue Origin, the space company Jeff Bezos founded in 2000, may also debut a prototype of its lunar lander. The spacecraft, called Blue Moon, is one of two vehicles NASA has picked to potentially ferry astronauts from lunar orbit down to the surface of the moon. Blue Origin’s contract for that task is worth $3.4 billion. (The other vehicle NASA selected is SpaceX’s Starship, which will aim to carry out the first landing in 2027.) A Blue Moon vehicle capable of carrying humans is likely at least a few years away from its debut, but Blue Origin plans to launch a “pathfinder” lander for cargo missions to the moon as soon as this year. It’s not clear exactly when, however, or if that timeline will stick. The mission will send a robotic lander to test Blue Moon’s design and engine capabilities, aiming to ensure a smooth ride for future missions with valuable science payloads or crew on board. NASA will also put one science instrument on board called Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume Surface Studies, or SCALPSS, which is a set of cameras designed to monitor how moon dust reacts to the engines of landers as they head in for touchdown. Blue Origin’s pathfinder spacecraft is slated to launch atop one of the company’s New Glenn rockets, which was set to make its debut flight Monday morning. But Blue Origin aborted the inaugural launch attempt as engineers worked to troubleshoot an undisclosed issue with the rocket. More moon missions are on the docket for later this year, though the complexity of such endeavors routinely leads to delays. That said, Intuitive Machines could launch its third robotic lunar mission, called IM-3, as soon as October. Astrobotic Technology may also get a chance to bounce back from a disappointing first go at a moon landing in 2024. Its Peregrine lander began leaking fuel after reaching space last January, forcing the vehicle to swing back toward Earth and abandon its lunar ambitions. The company has a new, larger vehicle — called Griffin — in the works for a launch as soon as this year. However, Astrobotic has already hit several complications with Griffin, including NASA’s cancellation of a rover meant to fly on board the lunar lander. That rover, called the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, remains in limbo. But Astrobotic has said it may outfit Griffin with some of the company’s own technology, such as infrastructure for its planned lunar power business called LunaGrid. Finally, according to a timeline laid out in early 2024, SpaceX may attempt to send an uncrewed Starship spacecraft — the most powerful launch vehicle ever made — to the moon. It’s not clear if that mission will actually happen in 2025. When reached for comment, a NASA spokesperson confirmed in an emailed statement that conducting an uncrewed test mission to the moon is part of the space agency’s development requirements for SpaceX’s Starship — but the statement did not say whether the rocket may be ready for such a demo this year. “NASA continues to work closely with SpaceX on progress toward milestones, including a design review, individual subsystem development and testing, and SpaceX’s integrated flight test campaign,” the space agency said. “Please refer to SpaceX for more information on their development progress.” SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment nor does the company typically respond to routine inquiries from reporters. Officials at NASA, however, have more recently indicated that SpaceX at least plans to ramp up Starship development this year, completing missions that will show how the spacecraft can be refueled once in orbit. (Starship is expected to need its propellant topped off multiple times as it sits in Earth orbit before it can complete a moon mission.) Whether all these missions squeeze onto the 2025 calendar remains to be seen. What’s certain, however, is that NASA, the commercial space sector, and nations around the globe are fomenting their desires to renew lunar exploration. NASA, for example, wants more than just to return American astronauts to the lunar surface: The federal agency is seeking to establish a permanent settlement there, angling to compete with the ambitions of China, which is aiming to put boots on the moon by 2030. The pursuits by the US and China are in part nationalistic and political. But the objectives are also scientific. “From a scientific perspective, if we think about it, the moon is a repository of information of what’s been happening to both the moon and Earth over time,” said Dr. Bethany Ehlmann, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology and the principal investigator for NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer orbiter. “So a big question is, where did this water on the moon come from? Is it ancient? And then, what does that tell us about how the Earth got water?”"
Blue Origin stands down from New Glenn launch attempt — again,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/science/new-glenn-blue-origin-rocket-launch-attempt/index.html,"Blue Origin, the rocket company founded by Jeff Bezos in 2000, has called off a second attempt to launch its 30-story New Glenn rocket. The vehicle had been slated to get off the ground early Monday, but the company waved off that plan so engineers could work to address a technical issue with the vehicle. By Monday evening, after roughly 16 hours with no update and no word on what exactly that problem was — Blue Origin took to social media to declare it could make a second attempt during a three-hour launch window that opens at 1 a.m. ET Tuesday. Just a couple of hours later, however, Blue Origin revealed it would not try for the overnight liftoff after all. “We’re moving our NG-1 launch to no earlier than Thursday, January 16,” the company said in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. That day, Blue Origin will have the same three-hour, early-morning launch window from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. ET. The company did not immediately say why it reversed course on plans to attempt a New Glenn launch Tuesday morning. But Blue Origin had cautioned earlier that unfavorable weather conditions at the takeoff site may lead to another scrub. “Tonight’s poor weather forecast at LC-36 could result in missing this window,” the company said in a Monday evening post. In the dispatch, Blue Origin also disclosed more detail on the problem engineers had sought to fix during the last attempt. “This morning’s scrub was due to ice forming in a purge line on an auxiliary power unit that powers some of our hydraulic systems,” the company said. A “purge line” is a pipe or tube that can be used to flush out any unwanted gases or debris from a rocket system. That detail was more than Blue Origin offered during its webcast of Monday’s launch attempt. At the time, the company revealed only that engineers were grappling with “anomalies,” which is aerospace parlance for issues with the rocket that must be fixed before giving the final green light for takeoff. “We are standing down from today’s launch attempt to troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue” said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin’s vice president of in-space systems. At one point Monday morning, the countdown clock crept down to show less than 10 minutes before liftoff, but Blue Origin periodically added more time as engineers worked to troubleshoot outstanding issues. Ultimately, the problems were not resolved with ample time before the launch window was set to close at 4 a.m. ET. A smooth inaugural liftoff for New Glenn could be crucial, as the company is hoping to gather copious data from this flight and pave the way for the rocket to quickly make an impact on the global launch industry. New Glenn is the first rocket developed by Blue Origin that aims to be capable of sending satellites to orbit — a feat that will be necessary for any company hoping to challenge SpaceX’s long-held dominance in the launch market. Blue Origin waved off the New Glenn launch heading into a busy week for spaceflight. Notably, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying two lunar landers is set to take off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center — which lies adjacent to Cape Canaveral — as soon as Wednesday at 1:11 a.m. ET. SpaceX is also due to kick off the seventh test flight of its gargantuan Starship rocket on Wednesday."
Moon rover-inspired robot could be a game-changer for Japan’s aging farmers,https://edition.cnn.com/science/japan-robot-farming-kisui-adam-spc/index.html,"Japan’s population is the oldest in the world, with a third aged over 65, and one in 10 aged over 80, due to a combination of low fertility rates and high life expectancy. This has a direct effect on its working-age population — the share of 15 to 64 year-olds — which is projected to shrink by 30 million people between 2020 and 2070. Agriculture is particularly hit by the problem: according to Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the number of people mainly employed in farming halved between 2000 and 2023, and those aged under 60 only make up about 20% of the total. To combat this shortage, along with a more relaxed stance on immigration and fertility policies, the country is increasingly looking at robotics to supplement the workforce. Tamir Blum founded Kisui Tech while still a student, in 2021 — a company that is using technology from space exploration to build an AI-assisted farming robot. “In the past 20 years or so, 50% of the farmers have retired, meaning that there’s more and more burden on fewer and fewer farmers to keep producing a stable food supply,” he says. The semi-autonomous robot is called Adam and is able to carry picked produce across difficult terrain as well as cut grass and spray fields with pesticides. Blum, an Israeli-American who first visited Japan in 2015, returned to the country in 2018 for a PhD during which he researched lunar rovers and their ability to navigate bumpy and uneven terrain. “During that PhD program, I traveled a lot around the Japanese countryside,” he says, “You can tell how much difficulty (it) is having with the labor shortage. You see many abandoned houses … The farmers are clearly getting older … I realized how difficult it was, and also the great potential for this type of off-road robotics technology to be applied, especially for outdoor orchards, which are also very, very bumpy — similar to what I was researching for space robotics.” Kisui Tech is working with the Agriculture Department at Chiba University, near Tokyo, in developing two models of Adam — a full-size and a mini version — and testing them in real-life scenarios on farms around Japan. The larger Adam is 70 centimeters high and 188 centimeters in length, and is aimed primarily at apple and pear farmers, with a large truckbed to carry produce or fertilizer. The smaller Adam, about one third of the size, is targeting grape and persimmon farms, which are planted in narrower rows. Alongside the robots, Kisui is also developing an online platform called Newton, which gives farmers real-time insights into crops, diseases, and farm management. Adam is expected to retail for around $20,000 on international markets. “I’ve been really amazed by the reaction of the farmers,” says Blum, “because in Japan, I think most people would have a stereotype that farmers are very traditional: they don’t like technology, they’re not willing to try new things. However … they’ve been very receptive, very willing to give advice, very willing to try Adam.” Adam is approaching commercial release and has been radically transformed from early versions based on feedback from the farmers. For example, a touchscreen was replaced by a panel with physical buttons, because farmers often wear gloves, which don’t work well with touchscreens. Kisui recently completed its first paid proof of concept to automate patrol and data collection at a solar plant for a Japanese power company. Blum says it has also received requests from the construction industry, looking to use the robot for patrols, security and transporting heavy goods. “We see Adam as a tool, not just for farming, but basically all outdoor work,” says Blum."
See the full wolf moon overtake Mars in the night sky and glimpse a planetary parade,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/science/full-moon-mars-bright-planets/index.html,"Keep an eye on the sky Monday evening to see the wolf moon, the first full moon of the year. And some sky-gazers will be able to glimpse a cosmic magic trick when the moon appears to pass in front of Mars. The full moon will be at peak illumination at 5:27 p.m. ET Monday but will appear full into Wednesday morning, according to NASA. Viewers in most of the continental United States, eastern Canada, and parts of Africa and Mexico can look for a celestial triangle in the sky when evening twilight ends at 6:11 p.m. ET. Mars will appear just to the lower left of the moon, while the bright star Pollux will be a few degrees to the upper left of the moon, according to NASA. Times for the moon passing in front of Mars will vary, so be sure to check your favorite sky-watching app. For those on the US East Coast, Mars will disappear behind the bottom of the moon around 9:16 p.m. ET and reappear behind the upper right of the moon at 10:31 p.m. ET. January’s full moon is commonly called the wolf moon because wolves are active this time of year and can be heard howling on cold winter nights, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. The origin of the name stems from the Sioux language, which describes this moon as “wolves run together.” But this wintry full moon also goes by other monikers. It’s known as the cold moon to the Cherokee people, the hard moon to the Lakota and the whirling wind moon to the Passamaquoddy tribe. European names also include the ice moon, the old moon or the moon after Yule, originally a three to 12-day festival that occurred in pre-Christian Europe near the winter solstice, according to NASA. January’s full moon also ties in with the beginning of the Hindu pilgrimage and 44-day festival of Prayag Kumbh Mela, held every 12 years in the Indian city of Prayagraj. The full moon will be visible around the world, weather permitting. If you’re in the Northern Hemisphere, bundle up to stay warm and enjoy the view. After Mars does its disappearing trick behind the moon, look for the red planet to appear at its closest and brightest on Wednesday. During January, Mars is at opposition, meaning it’s directly opposite the sun from the vantage point of Earth. As the two planets travel along their orbital paths, Earth will be between Mars and the sun. The red planet will shine brightly each evening, according to NASA. Look for it in the east each night, as well as in the northwest at dawn. Mars isn’t the only planet to keep an eye out for this month. Sky-gazers can look forward to catching glimpses of four bright planets at the same time in the night sky. Venus and Saturn will appear in the southwest, Jupiter will gleam overhead, and Mars will appear to rise in the east. The planets will appear to rotate westward around the bright star Polaris and will be visible each night beginning early in the evening. Venus and Saturn will slowly appear to come close together in the night sky during what’s called the Venus and Saturn conjunction, although they are hundreds of millions of miles apart. The two planets will appear the nearest to one another on Friday and Saturday because of the positions of their orbits around the sun. Uranus and Neptune will be visible, too, albeit with the aid of binoculars or telescopes, according to EarthSky. While some may rush to call this parade a special alignment of the planets, there’s nothing unusual about it — although seeing four or five bright planets in the night sky at once is less common. Planets always appear along a line in the sky because they all orbit the sun in a mostly flat plane called the ecliptic. “Planets in our solar system, when they are visible, are always in a line because they follow the path of the sun — the ecliptic — across our sky. But they aren’t in a line stretching out, one behind another, from the sun, into 3-dimensional space,” according to EarthSky. So, enjoy the spectacle as bright planets appear to march across the night sky this month, and if you want to glimpse even more, set up a telescope and potentially spot moons around some of these neighboring worlds. Check out the following events occurring in our skies to add to your calendar. February 12: Snow moon March 14: Worm moon April 12: Pink moon May 12: Flower moon June 11: Strawberry moon July 10: Buck moon August 9: Sturgeon moon September 7: Corn moon October 6: Harvest moon November 5: Beaver moon December 4: Cold moon In 2025, there will be two partial solar eclipses. A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, but none of the celestial bodies is perfectly aligned, according to NASA.Unlike during a total solar eclipse, the moon only blocks part of the sun’s face, creating a crescent shape in which it appears the moon is taking a “bite” out of the sun. The first partial solar eclipse will happen on March 29, and it will be visible across parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and North and South America. The second partial solar eclipse will fall on September 21 and be visible over parts of Australia and Antarctica as well as some islands in the Pacific Ocean. There will also be two total lunar eclipses that occur during the March and September full moon events. A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when Earth is between the sun and moon and the three celestial objects line up in a row so that the moon passes into our planet’s shadow. When the moon is within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra, it takes on a reddish hue, which has led to the nickname “blood moon” for a lunar eclipse, according to NASA. That shadow isn’t perfect, so faint sunbeams sneak around the shadow’s edges on all sides in the colors of a sunset, bathing the moon in brilliant, warm hues. The first total lunar eclipse will be visible between March 13-14 and cross over Western Europe, parts of Asia, parts of Australia, western Africa, North and South America, and Antarctica. The second total lunar eclipse will occur on September 7-8 and be visible from Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of eastern South America, Alaska and Antarctica. Check Time and Date’s website to see when each of these eclipses will appear and the locations that will be able to view them.

A powerful potential challenger to SpaceX’s rocket dominance is poised to launch,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/science/new-glenn-launch-blue-origin/index.html,"Nearly a quarter century after Jeff Bezos founded Blue Origin, the rocket company is poised for its most defining moment to date: sending a vehicle to orbit for the first time. Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket is set to make its inaugural launch attempt as soon as 1 a.m. ET Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. A live stream of the mission is slated to kick off about an hour before liftoff on the social media platform X, Blue Origin’s YouTube channel, and its website, the company said via email. The new target launch time was announced after Blue Origin chose to wave off plans to get New Glenn off the ground in the early hours of Sunday morning. The company said weather conditions at sea, where the company hopes to recover part of the rocket after launch, prompted the 24-hour delay. The roughly 320-foot (98-meter) New Glenn is not only the first Blue Origin rocket designed to be capable of hauling satellites to space, it’s also among the most powerful in the world. Categorized as a heavy-lift launch vehicle, it packs more than twice the power that SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket gives off during takeoff. The uncrewed New Glenn mission will carry Blue Origin-made demonstration technology, called the Blue Ring Pathfinder, to orbit. If successful, New Glenn’s launch debut could position Blue Origin to better compete with Elon Musk’s SpaceX — which has long dominated the commercial launch sector. If all goes according to plan, the New Glenn rocket will fire up seven BE-4 engines at the base of its first-stage rocket booster, which is the largest part of the vehicle that gives the first burst of power at liftoff. A few minutes into flight, after burning through most of its fuel, the booster will detach from the upper portion of the rocket, which includes the vehicle’s nose cone, or payload fairing, that’s designed to shield cargo during liftoff. The booster will then use fins and strakes — or winglike attachments that flare out from its top and base, respectively — to help guide itself toward its landing target, a seafaring recovery platform named Jacklyn after Bezos’ mother. Just before touching down on the platform, the booster will reignite some of its engines and deploy six massive legs to stand on. The landing maneuver, designed to allow Blue Origin to refurbish and reuse rocket boosters— much like SpaceX does with its Falcon rockets — is an attempt to save money and drive down the cost of launches. Meanwhile, the upper portion of New Glenn, carrying the Blue Ring Pathfinder experiment, will continue toward the cosmos. Two engines, optimized to function in the vacuum of space, should fire up and propel the vehicle to speeds necessary to enter orbit — typically around 17,500 miles per hour, or nearly 23 times the speed of sound. For this flight, Blue Origin said it will not deploy a satellite into orbit. Rather, the Blue Ring Pathfinder payload is expected to remain attached to the rocket’s upper stage for the duration of the six-hour mission. Success is not guaranteed. At any point during the flight, New Glenn could encounter a mission-ending failure. So far, the company has only ignited all seven BE-4 engines at the base of this rocket for 24 seconds during a ground test in late December. For this flight, the engines must fire for at least several times that duration as New Glenn attempts to defy Earth’s gravitational pull. If something goes wrong, and New Glenn begins to fly off its intended course, the company may be forced to implement a self-destruct feature — blowing the rocket to smithereens so it will not pose a threat to people or property. Blue Origin could also see success on its primary mission: safely getting the rocket’s second stage and Blue Ring Pathfinder technology into its intended orbit. But even if that objective goes to plan, the company may still fail to land its New Glenn rocket booster on the Jacklyn platform after launch. Failure to safely land the rocket booster, however, would not make the mission unsuccessful: Recovering rocket parts for reuse is a feat aimed solely at saving Blue Origin money. Most rocket builders, apart from SpaceX, discard that portion of the rocket after launch anyway. If and when New Glenn proves it can get the job done, the vehicle is likely to make a big splash in the launch market, said Caleb Henry, the director of research at Quilty Space, which provides data and analysis about the space sector. “They are postured so that they can come in and try to fill this role of being the next great, reliable launch provider for the industry,” Henry said. The New Glenn is a heavy-lift vehicle, Henry noted, and vehicles of its size and power have “grown in importance over the years.” Roughly a decade ago, rocket companies anticipated that small, lightweight rockets would become the next launch phenomenon because they would be capable of rapidly launching satellites intended to flesh out a string of megaconstellations — or networks of small satellites — in low-Earth orbit. “But two things happened,” Henry said. “First is that none of the constellation (operators) went to small rockets. They all went to the medium- or heavy-lift because getting more up in a single mission is faster and more economical than doing this one or two satellites at a time. And then the second is those satellites themselves got bigger.”"
Risks from ash and air pollution remain for people returning after wildfires. Here’s how to stay safe,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/health/la-wildfires-air-pollution-symptoms-safety/index.html,"As some people return to the structures spared from Los Angeles wildfires, experts warn that they should be careful of the air inside and especially cautious when cleaning up. Smoke, ash and all the toxic chemicals that come with both can seep into even well-sealed homes and pose risks to health. “There’s a lot that has potentially happened to affect poor air quality in your home, even if you haven’t suffered any physical damage to the home itself,” said Katherine Pruitt, national senior director for policy at the American Lung Association. “The fumes and the ash, the particles that are going to be in your indoor environment, are not safe to breathe. You especially don’t want to come into contact with the ash in your lungs, eyes or skin.” Los Angeles Public Health has declared a local health emergency for the entire county due to the fires. It prohibits the use of air blowers, including leaf blowers, in order to reduce health risks due to the ash and particulate matter from smoke. Wildfires burn a lot more than trees and grass. The burned cars and structures can release toxic chemicals. Even after fires die down and smoke dissipates, walls, floors, furniture and other indoor surfaces may absorb toxic chemicals and smoke. These surfaces can off-gas for weeks or even months, studies show, although that will reduce over time. Wildfires contribute to harmful fine particle pollution, which is at levels bad for human health in the area even before the wildfires. The American Lung Association’s State of the Air report for 2024 listed the Los Angeles area as one of the top 10 cities polluted by year-round particle pollution. It’s been No. 1 for ozone pollution for decades, Pruitt said. With the wildfires now on top of that, the air quality index has been sitting at “unhealthy” levels for many parts of Southern California for several days. Toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest that particle pollution from wildfires is more harmful to the respiratory system than equal doses of particle pollution from other causes. Exposure to particle pollution can make the eyes burn and the nose run, and it can embed deep in the lungs, leading to breathing problems such as bronchitis. The minuscule particles can also get into the bloodstream and cause inflammation, aggravating diabetes, chronic heart disease and other health conditions. A 2024 study of the Marshall Fire in the Boulder, Colorado, area showed that bad air hung around inside homes even after the smoke had cleared. Researchers found elevated levels of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ash, in addition to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air samples inside people’s homes. VOCs can be toxic to humans, and at least one VOC, benzene, is known to cause cancer. Exposure to PAHs is also associated with increased cancer incidence, according to the World Health Organization. When researchers in the Boulder study surveyed nearby residents, they reported symptoms related to the smoke and ash including headaches, coughing, sneezing, sore throat and watery eyes even six months after the 2021 fire. Those who lived closer to burned-out buildings reported more symptoms. The number of people reporting symptoms declined a year after the fire, but even two years out, about a third of those surveyed reported at least one smoke- and ash-related symptom. There are some ways to reduce exposure to these harmful substances if you’re in an area affected by wildfires. The US Environmental Protection Agency recommends checking HVAC filters every few days and changing them if they look dirty. A clean filter is much more effective at protecting inside air. People who have HVAC systems that use a high-efficiency filter (MERV-13 or higher) should run the system’s fan as often as possible by putting the fan to “On” rather than the “Auto” setting. Portable air cleaners can help, too. Those with HEPA filters and charcoal filters work best, Pruitt said. The EPA suggests putting air cleaners in rooms where people spend the most time and running them as often as possible on the highest fan speed until any smells go away. The EPA also suggests limiting activities that can create even more fine particle pollution, such as frying or broiling food. Avoid vacuuming unless the vacuum has a HEPA filter, and don’t smoke or vape indoors. Although there may be a lingering smell from the wildfire, don’t burn candles or incense inside, which just creates more particle pollution. And soap and water are best for cleaning, rather than aerosols or chemical cleaners that may interact with some of the chemicals in ash. Don’t try to clean with a traditional vacuum or broom, which will just push the tiny particles into the air. If you’re using a vacuum with a HEPA filter, start by misting surfaces with water to keep ash from floating around. When cleaning, wear gloves, goggles, long sleeves and long pants and socks to protect skin, and use a N95 or a P100 respirator mask to keep from breathing in ash. “Not a surgical mask. Not a cloth mask. Those aren’t good enough to keep out those very fine particles and some of the gases that you might need to worry about,” Pruitt said. Ash should be washed off skin as quickly as possible. Before leaving a cleanup site, change clothes so ash doesn’t get tracked into the car or into other locations. People who have heart or lung diseases like asthma or COPD, the elderly, children and pregnant people should all avoid ash cleanup work because particle pollution is particularly hard on their systems. Older and younger bodies have a harder time expelling pollution from their lungs. Pets should be kept out of the ash since they are also more susceptible to getting sick. Wash their paws if they do walk through it. And no matter how quickly you’re trying to clean, Pruitt said, it’s good to take fresh air breaks frequently. “Hopefully, the outdoor air will have cleared up and you can open up the house and start to air it out,” she said. “If the outdoor air is still smoky, create a clean room with an air cleaner so you can go in there and take a break. And if you experience any symptoms like breathing problems or pain or discomfort, stop cleaning and check with your health care provider before you continue.”"
Wildfires are a threat to mental health that can linger even years later,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/health/wildfires-impact-mental-health/index.html,"Dr. Jyoti Mishra personally knows how much stress can come with a wildfire. The associate director of the UC Climate Change and Mental Health Council and associate professor of psychiatry works at the University of California, San Diego. Her city isn’t currently experiencing wildfires, but her LA-based family has fled to her home. “All our family from LA is here with us, and we’re happy they’ve made it,” Mishra said Thursday. “We’re hoping their home is safe up there, but we don’t know yet.” Uncertainty about losing a home or a neighborhood is one factor, studies have showed, that can contribute to an increase in mental health problems among people who experience wildfires. Mishra’s research on the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California showed that people who were personally affected by wildfires were significantly more likely to have anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress than members of communities that had not been exposed to a fire. “It can also make you feel cognitively impacted, as well,” Mishra said. “Our work has shown that it’s hard to pay attention to a singular thing when everything around you feels like it’s threatening you.” That means the hundreds of thousands of people who are under evacuation orders or warnings amid some of the worst wildfires in the history of the Los Angeles area face threats not just their physical safety but also their mental health – and not just immediately after the fire passes. Mishra’s studies have also showed that some people experienced problems months, or even years, after wildfires. In the immediate term, several studies have found, wildfires can be destabilizing and cause people to feel stressed and to experience feelings of anger, sadness, shock, depression and frustration. People may also lose their appetites, have trouble sleeping or have nightmares, and they may turn to drugs or alcohol to self-medicate, studies show. Depression, anxiety and trauma can affect even more people long-term, even if they never had such mental health concerns before, and research shows that post-traumatic stress disorder can linger three months to even a decade past a wildfire. It isn’t just the uncertainty of knowing what happens to your neighborhood. It’s also the smoke itself, according to Dr. Yang Liu, chair of environmental health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. His 2024 study showed an association between emergency department visits for anxiety disorders and exposure to wildfire smoke. The effect was more pronounced in women, girls and older adults, with major smoke events significantly amplifying this risk. “Inhaling a lot of smoke can trigger an anxiety disorder. LA’s air quality level is 10 to 20 times above the national center, so it’s certainly a severe smoke event for the entire Southern California region. Certainly, the LA metro region is engulfed by heavy smoke,” Liu said. People should protect their physical and mental health by staying out of the smoke as much as possible, he said. “People should take precautions and close windows, avoid doing outdoor activities, and if they have a HEPA filter in their A/C system or a standalone air filter, they should turn it on,” Liu said. It’s not just adults who should take precautions. Although children can be more resilient, Cedars-Sinai child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Sabrina Renteria said, they can also feel more helpless when a wildfire is in the area. Renteria said the fires have not reached where she lives in Marina del Rey, but her house keeps losing power from the strong winds, and the Cedars-Sinai emergency room where she works often sees more children with mental health concerns when there are wildfires. “We absolutely anticipate that this will have a huge uptick in mental health issues with children,” Renteria said. Children are intuitive, she said, and can sense when something is wrong, so adults need to help them cope by being honest about what’s happening and talking to them about how they’re feeling. “I think openly communicating with their child, saying ‘yes, I’m feeling really sad today.’ Or explaining that ‘there’s a lot of things around us that’s been troubling me,’ and you can give examples, but then you can talk to them about how you’re going to cope with this,” Renteria said. Children and adults alike should get professional help if feelings like anxiety or depression linger. Renteria said it’s also important to get children back to their routine, classes and friends as quickly as they can, to whatever extent is possible. “Just so they have this sense of stability, because children can be very easily destabilized when their routine is sporadic,” she said. Teens and children mimic their parents and loved ones, “so it’s also very important that, if you’re experiencing a tragedy, that you practice and display good coping mechanisms,” Renteria said. “So it’s important for a parent to take care of themselves, as well.” Something as simple as listening to music can help the body destress naturally, she said; so can deep-breathing exercises. “It helps slow your body’s natural response to anxiety and stimulates the vagus nerve, and it calms your whole body,” Renteria said. Mishra also recommends mindfulness exercises. Being mindful and present in the moment and not letting the traumas of the past slip into the present can help heal the brain, she said. Volunteering to help people in the community can be healing, Renteria suggests. Talking with others who also experienced the wildfires can also help children and adults acknowledge how they’re feeling and to find common ground in their experiences, but it’s important to be aware of how they’re responding. “When you’re communicating with other people, it shouldn’t be a bunch of doom and gloom, especially in front of your child. And for teachers too, since children take cues from their elders,” she said. Children and adults should limit how much news and social media they see. Adults could also check out news stories before watching them with their children and then have a conversation about them. They might want to use the stories as an opportunity to point out the good work first responders and volunteers are doing. “In many times, for these kinds of disasters, we put them in this framework of doom and gloom, but we need to shift that to a survive-and-thrive framework, where the planet that we have is just one planet and that if we all work together, we can make better things happen,” Mishra said. People also need to be careful not to isolate themselves in the wake of the wildfires, she said. Those who have stronger family connections and community support are more resilient, her research shows. “Collective healing is needed,” Mishra said. People who are watching the wildfires from far away should be sure to keep friends and family in California in mind. “Definitely reach out to others,” Mishra said. There are also ways to help meet the basic needs of people who fled their homes quickly, without food or funds, by contributing directly. “Just so that they can get by on a day-to-day basis and focus on rebuilding instead of having to worry about where they are going to get dinner today,” Mishra said. “These are just little things that we can all help out with others, because eventually, with climate change, this is not something that’s isolated to a region. It may happen one day to any of us.”"

"Rising HMPV cases in China are ‘what we would expect to see’ in winter, health officials say",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/health/human-metapneumovirus-hmpv-cases-china-us/index.html,"As China experiences a rise in respiratory infections this winter, one little-known virus has gotten a lot of attention – and some people may worry whether the rise in cases could be felt more broadly around the world. Human metapneumovirus, also known as HMPV, can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, and data from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released last week shows that the country has seen more cases in recent weeks. But HMPV typically circulates in the Northern Hemisphere in winter, and China’s CDC data shows that there have also been rises in a number of other common respiratory infections, including the seasonal flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. “China’s reported levels of respiratory infections are within the normal range. It’s what we would expect to see for the winter season,” Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, said in a news briefing Tuesday. To calm concerns, she added that hospital utilization in China is lower than at this time last year and that there have been no emergency declarations or emergency responses launched in the country in connection with these respiratory infections. “Regarding human metapneumovirus, it’s not a new virus,” Harris said. “It was first identified in 2001. It’s been in the human population for a long time. It is a common virus that circulates in winter and spring.” In the United States, the CDC tracks cases of HMPV in the same way it tracks the spread of other respiratory viruses. It’s estimated that about 10% to 12% of respiratory illnesses in children are caused by HMPV; most people will get HMPV at some point before age 5, and then reinfections can occur throughout life. Data shows that HMPV cases started to show up more frequently in November and have been rising since. But, compared with other common viruses, the weekly percent of respiratory infections testing positive for HMPV has been low, at 1.94% as of December 28. In comparison, flu was at 18.71% and Covid-19 at 7.10% that week. “It’s respiratory virus season for a reason. We’ve gotten very accustomed to thinking about those that have been really severe – so Covid, as well as flu and RSV – but there are a host of other respiratory viruses out there that you can get sick with,” said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. When it comes to common respiratory infections like HMPV, “many times, you get better on your own, but not necessarily always,” Hamilton said. “Typically, infections are relatively mild, and we often think about it like the common cold,” she added. “Many people don’t necessarily know when they have a common cold that it is caused by human metapneumovirus, but it’s definitely one of the viruses that are often associated with the common cold.” Some of the symptoms commonly associated with HMPV infections include cough, fever, stuffy nose and shortness of breath. HMPV spreads from person to person in a similar way as some other respiratory viruses: through droplets from coughing or sneezing and through touch, such as shaking hands or touching contaminated surfaces. “Simple measures can prevent spread. And these include, if you’re sick, if you’ve got symptoms, stay home,” Harris said. “Also, if you’re in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces, when you know that there’s a virus currently circulating, think about wearing a mask. Improve ventilation where you can,” she said. “And of course, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue.” Some people are at increased risk of severe infections with HMPV, Harris said. “In some cases, like any of the common cold viruses, it can lead to more severe disease in people who’ve got no immunity or have got very weak immune systems,” she said. “That’s the very young. That’s newborn babies – that’s why you don’t go and visit a newborn baby and kiss it when you’ve got a cold – and the very old. Again, that’s why you should not go and visit your over-90 great-grandmother in hospital when you’ve got a cold.” Health care providers can test for HMPV, but there is no vaccine, and there is no specific antiviral therapy to treat infections. Resting at home and staying hydrated can help with symptoms, as well as some over-the-counter medications. Mild cases of HMPV usually last a few days to a week, and many people recover by themselves within two to five days. “It will present in the same way as flu, sars-cov-2, RSV, so the same advice applies for those affected – rest, take on fluids, try not to spread it to others,” John Tregoning, a professor in vaccine immunology at Imperial College London, said in a statement distributed Monday by the UK-based Science Media Centre. “If you do feel very unwell go to your GP,” he said. “As it is a virus, antibiotics won’t have any effect.”"
"To heal America’s ills, outgoing surgeon general offers ‘parting prescription’: stronger community",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/health/surgeon-general-parting-prescription-community/index.html,"As US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy nears the end of his second term as the nation’s doctor, a final diagnosis of his patient suggests that a great deficiency of connectivity has led to a poor prognosis for America’s overall health and well-being. To treat the “widespread pain and unhappiness” that has left the country deeply unwell, he says, his “parting prescription” for the American people is to cultivate a strong sense of community to help themselves and others. “Community is a powerful source of life satisfaction and life expectancy,” Murthy wrote in an essay published Tuesday. “It’s where we know each other, help each other, and find purpose in contributing to each other’s lives.” Building community creates fulfillment, he said, and there are three key elements that make it possible: connection with others through relationships, acts of service to help others and a sense of purpose in life – all pursued through love, instead of fear or hate. “Relationships, service, and purpose are the time-tested triad of fulfillment that stands in contrast to wealth, fame, and power which define the modern-day triad of success,” Murthy wrote. “The triad of success is focused on the individual. The triad of fulfillment connects us with something bigger than the individual,” the surgeon general said. “The triad of success may earn us praise and possessions. The triad of fulfillment gives us meaning and belonging.” The US surgeon general typically serves as the voice of the administration’s public health policy while promoting their own agenda of issues that they feel are important to the health of American people. This final reflection from Murthy captures themes from his work under multiple administrations, first from 2014 to 2017 under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump and a second term under President Joe Biden since 2021. His initiatives have focused on the addiction crisis, youth mental health, loneliness and isolation, workplace well-being, parental stress and social media’s impact on youth. “Social media has turbocharged a culture of constant comparison that too often undermines our self-worth and makes us feel dissatisfied with our lives,” Murthy wrote Tuesday. “Trying to fill our internal void with approval and accolades and addictive forces isn’t helping.” Although Murthy’s latest reflection pulls from personal experience and is not meant to be a scientific report, it does cite about two dozen studies that help show how social connectivity can affect physical and mental health. “Being socially disconnected increases our risk of heart disease, dementia, depression, anxiety, and premature death,” he wrote, yet about a third of adults and half of young people experience loneliness. Individual purpose, anchored in helping others, can also strengthen physical and mental health, Murthy said. “A high sense of individual purpose may reduce the risk of early death as well as stroke, lung disease, and dementia for some. Research also shows that people with a strong sense of purpose may experience lower levels of depression and anxiety and greater resilience in the face of stress,” he wrote, citing five different studies. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated feelings of loneliness and isolation in the US, Murthy said, but divisiveness has been eroding the country’s well-being for even longer. “It is fueling not only illness and despair on an individual level, but also pessimism and distrust across society which have all made it painfully difficult to rise together in response to common challenges,” he wrote. “As I finish my tenure as Surgeon General, this is my parting prescription, my final wish for all of us: Choose community.” Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a New York family physician and Fox News medical contributor, is Trump’s pick to replace Murthy as surgeon general in his new administration. Several health experts have said that she’s a reasonable choice but that she may be tested with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, as Trump’s pick to helm the US Department of Health and Human Services."
A guide to Pete Hegseth’s confirmation hearing,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/politics/hegseth-confirmation-hearing-defense-secretary/index.html,"Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon, will face a Senate panel Tuesday for his confirmation hearing as he is expected to be questioned over allegations ranging from sexual assault to excessive drinking in the workplace. Hegseth has denied all accusations and made several trips to Capitol Hill to shore up support since he was announced as Trump’s pick in November, including meeting with senators as recently as last week. But it’s unclear as of Tuesday whether the veteran and former Fox News host has managed to convince the Senate Armed Services Committee so that his nomination can be referred to the full chamber for a vote. In his opening statement obtained by CNN, Hegseth is expected to tell the committee that he wishes to restore a “warrior culture” to the Defense Department. The remarks do not address questions about Hegseth’s personal life. “It is true that I don’t have a similar biography to Defense Secretaries of the last 30 years,” Hegseth is expected to say. “But, as President Trump also told me, we’ve repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with supposedly ‘the right credentials’ —whether they are retired generals, academics, or defense contractor executives—and where has it gotten us? He believes, and I humbly agree, that it’s time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.” Trump has defended his pick amid the allegations and in December said he remained confident that Hegseth will be confirmed. However, CNN has reported the Trump transition team has compiled a list of potential alternatives should Hegseth falter. Here’s what to know about Hegseth and his confirmation hearing. Hegseth is a decorated combat veteran who was deployed in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Iraq and Afghanistan. He has earned two Bronze Star Medals for his service in Iraq and Afghanistan. He went on to lead two veteran advocacy nonprofits, Vets for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America, and joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014, eventually becoming a co-host of the weekend “Fox & Friends” show. Trump considered Hegseth for a Cabinet position during his first term, including Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and though he was ultimately passed over, Hegseth remained in Trump’s orbit. He acted as an informal adviser to Trump for a number of years while he was in and out of office, Trump advisers told CNN. As a Fox News host, Hegseth made $4.6 million, according to his financial disclosure, which covered the past two years. He left the role in November amid his announcement as Trump’s pick for defense secretary. Hegseth also made approximately $1 million on speaking fees across dozens of engagements in 2023 and 2024, many of which were at conservative or Christian organizations, and brought in royalties from three books he has written. According to the financial disclosure, Hegseth held stock in several major defense contractors as well, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Honeywell. The value of the assets was relatively small, listed between $1,001 and $15,000 for each of the companies. Hegseth also held between $15,001 and $50,000 of Bitcoin. CNN has reported that as Hegseth’s public profile grew, he faced deepening private turmoil. His second wife, Samantha, filed for divorce in 2017, shortly after Fox executive producer Jennifer Rauchet — with whom he had been having an affair — gave birth to their baby. During divorce proceedings, a court-appointed parenting consultant chastised Hegseth in one letter for his conduct around his sons, writing that he had shown “hostile and degrading communication” toward Samantha. Hegseth stated in a court filing that he thought the court-appointed consultant’s letter was “heavy handed,” though he committed to learning from his mistakes. His attorney said that the proceedings were typical for divorce cases, noting that Hegseth has a great relationship with his kids and adding that “this is why people get divorced – because they fight.” Hegseth’s treatment of women was criticized by his own mother, who wrote in a 2018 letter obtained by The New York Times in late November that that there are “many” women whom he has “abused in some way” and encouraged him to “get some help.” Shortly after, Penelope Hegseth went on Fox News to retract the letter and defend her son, and she told the Times that she wrote the email “in anger, with emotion.” Pete Hegseth’s mother said that she had immediately apologized in a separate email, and she said her own characterization of his treatment of women in the email “has never been true.” Hegseth was accused by a woman of sexually assaulting her in October 2017 following a speaking engagement at a conference held by a Republican women’s group in Monterey, California. According to a police report obtained by CNN, the woman told police that Hegseth physically blocked her from leaving a hotel room, took her phone and then sexually assaulted her even though she “remembered saying ‘no’ a lot.” Hegseth told police that their encounter was consensual and that he had repeatedly made sure the woman “was comfortable with what was going on between the two of them.” Hegseth was not charged with a crime in connection with the allegation. In response to the reporting of the police report, his lawyer Tim Parlatore told CNN that the “police found the allegations to be false, which is why no charges were filed,”— although the report does not say that police found the allegations to be false. Hegseth continues to deny any wrongdoing and maintains that the encounter was consensual. Years later, he paid the woman as part of a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality clause. Hegseth’s lawyer said that he settled because he was worried it was during the “Me Too” movement and he didn’t want to lose his job at Fox News if the accusation became public. Hegseth has also been accused of mismanaging funds at Vets for Freedom, including inappropriate expenses such as parties one former associate of the group described as “trysts,” according to The New Yorker. During a later leadership stint at Concerned Veterans for America, former employees sent a letter to the nonprofit’s senior management with a slew of allegations related to excessive drinking and treatment of female staff, the magazine further reported. The magazine did not name the employees and CNN has not independently reviewed the report. Among the allegations were that Hegseth had to be restrained from joining the dancers on stage at a Louisiana strip club where he had brought his team. The complaint also alleged Hegseth’s management team “sexually pursued” employees and divided the organization’s female staffers into two groups — “party girls” and “not party girls.” He has also been accused of ignoring a female employee’s allegation that another member of Hegseth’s staff attempted to sexually assault her. The magazine also alleges that it obtained a letter that alleged Hegseth, in a separate incident, “passed out” in the back of a party bus and then urinated in front of a hotel where the organization’s team was staying. Responding to the New Yorker’s reporting, a Hegseth adviser said in a statement to CNN, “We’re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through the New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s.” One longtime Fox News producer told CNN years before Hegseth became Trump’s pick that his drinking habit was an “open secret” on the set of “Fox & Friends” and that he had more than once noticed beer cans in the trash inside Hegseth’s office. Hegseth has previously acknowledged that he was drinking heavily as he transitioned from military to civilian life, but he denies having a drinking problem and has vowed to quit drinking all together if he’s confirmed. Hegseth has on several occasions slammed the policies of the very department he could soon lead. He has criticized efforts to allow women into combat roles, accusing the military of lowering standards to allow women into those jobs. Hegseth said on a podcast last year that he took issue specifically with women in “physical, labor-intensive type jobs,” such as those with the Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, Army Special Forces, Marine Forces Special Operations and jobs such as those in infantry, armor and artillery units. On the same podcast, Hegseth also criticized the military’s diversity programs, saying, “Woke sh*t has got to go.” In his 2024 book “The War on Warriors” and in subsequent media promotions last year, he condemned policies allowing gay people to serve openly in the US military, calling them part of a “Marxist” agenda to prioritize social justice over combat readiness. During the widespread protests following George Floyd’s death in 2020, Hegseth supported ordering active-duty troops to put down riots. And like Trump, Hegseth has also praised waterboarding as an “effective” tactic. Hegseth also urged Trump to be tougher on some issues, such as pushing the then-president to take further action against Iran after the president ordered a drone strike in January 2020 that killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. Hegseth also spread baseless conspiracy theories about the US Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, claiming the initial break-in was a false flag operation carried out by leftist groups disguised as Trump supporters. As he continues to deny the mounting allegations, Hegseth has attempted to convince members of the key Senate Armed Services Committee and has vowed to “fight like hell” to win confirmation. Hegseth met with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week and sought to address any last-minute concerns ahead of Tuesday’s hearing. During similar meetings with senators last month, a senior transition official told CNN that Hegseth faced blunt questions from members and nearly every meeting included a discussion about the role of women in combat following reports of him supporting a ban on women from combat roles. In conversations with senators, Hegseth chose not to lean into controversial policies he has supported and instead conveyed that his aim is to “make this military lethal again,” the official said. Parlatore told CNN early last month that Hegseth’s name was submitted for an FBI background check, and subsequently shared that the confidentiality agreement with his accuser and the complaint from former employees at Concerned Veterans for America were submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Senate Armed Services Committee, chaired by GOP Sen. Roger Wicker, will question Hegseth during a confirmation hearing before voting on whether to advance his nomination for a full vote in the Senate. Wicker and Ranking Member Jack Reed, a Democrat, were briefed Friday night on the FBI’s background check of Hegseth, sources told CNN. Per the committee’s practices, other members of the committee will not receive a briefing. Hegseth will need to limit defections in the chamber to three GOP senators assuming all Democrats vote against him. A group of Democrats in the committee has argued that the allegations against Hegseth should disqualify him from leading the Pentagon. Committee member Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — who sent a 33-page letter to Hegseth outlining more than 70 questions that she and other Democrats have for him — argued that Hegseth is not qualified. “We need someone who will be sober, who is someone who has gained the respect and trust of the troops, and someone who has demonstrated that he can actually manage an organization — not just 40 people, which has been his experience — but that he’s really ready to take on an organization of 3.5 million people,” Warren told CNN last week. Meanwhile, key Republicans on the panel have signaled openness to backing Hegseth. Among the Republican members of the committee who were initially hesitant to back him was Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, a survivor of sexual assault who has advocated for women in the military and is seen as a key potential swing vote. After conversations with Hegseth last month — one of which Ernst described as “thoughtful” and policy-focused — the senator said the defense pick “is very supportive of women in the military,” despite his previous comments. However, while she said she will “support Pete through this process,” she would not comment on whether she feels confident with Hegseth’s denials over the sexual assault allegation. Trump has continued to back Hegseth, which sets up a challenge for any GOP senator who might go up against him. With Trump’s picks to face confirmation hearings soon, GOP senators are being careful to pick their battles and cautious of how they approach the president-elect’s selections."

"American Battleground: As Trump plots his Day One agenda, Democrats look for a way forward",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/politics/trump-day-one-agenda-democrats-path-analysis/index.html,"Court is in session at Mar-a-Lago, and it is the kind of court the owner likes. Even when he was president, Donald Trump seemed to prefer the golf shirts and sunshine of his Florida home over the formality of the White House, and a watchdog group clocked him making 134 visits to that private club and golf course during his first term in office. There, many observers noted, he basked in standing ovations when he walked to his private table for dinner. He greeted an endless stream of friends and admirers. And now, it is a river: Job and influence seekers, friends of friends, the rich, famous and powerful, even people who have paid members of the club to get them past the front door – all jockeying for any stray minute with the victorious president-elect. The list of those seeking an audience will grow to include some of the biggest names in business: Tim Cook from Apple, Sundar Pichai from Google, Ted Sarandos from Netflix, and Jeff Bezos from Amazon. “I had dinner with almost all of them and the rest are coming,” Trump will eventually say of his fellow billionaires, dryly noting the change in atmosphere. “The first term everybody was fighting me. This term everybody wants to be my friend.” It seems hardly coincidental weeks later, when Mark Zuckerberg of Meta decides to cut fact checkers from Facebook and Instagram – a feature right-wingers have often howled about. Some outside observers, such as CNN’s Jim Acosta who covered Trump’s first term, are watching the pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago skeptically. “It seems bending the knee is in for 2025. A lot of people think that will take you places, and it tends to lead to bad places… with Trump.” Still, after the long months of campaigning, he is reportedly content to let the world come to him for a change. While loyal staffers scramble to simultaneously prepare for the transition and house hunt in DC, the boss is playing golf, talking to candidates for administration jobs, and meeting favor-seekers on the patio. “He’s been very active, but he gets to do it from base camp. He’s happy laying low right now,” a Trump adviser tells CNN. And what better place to rock boats than a seaside town? As promised during his campaign, Trump is wasting no time laying out an aggressive, immediate – and for his foes, alarming – agenda. “It’s going to be at lightning speed,” adviser Stephen Miller says of the coming changes on Fox News, noting the new White House team is “prepared, under President Trump’s leadership, to implement historical, transformative, long-awaited change to make this government accountable to the people of this country once again. It will be as Donald Trump said, a new golden age for America.” On his pledge to make the economy better and pull inflation down even further than President Joe Biden already has, Trump has a one-word answer: Tariffs. “I’m a big believer in tariffs,” he tells NBC’s “Meet the Press” in his first post-election network TV interview, echoing comments from his campaign. “I think tariffs are the most beautiful word. I think they’re beautiful. It’s going to make us rich.” Many who have shared Trump’s orbit for years say he profoundly believes in the power of these fees imposed on goods imported to the US from other countries. He cites tariffs as an almost mythical fix for trade imbalances, loss of domestic manufacturing jobs, and a potential key to eliminating taxes up to and including the federal income tax. He likes to talk about the tariffs he launched during his first term, some of which the Biden administration maintained. “I had a lot of tariffs on a lot of different countries, but in particular China. We took in hundreds of billions of dollars, and we had no inflation.” The problem? An overwhelming majority of economic experts say that last part is untrue, and most of Trump’s ideas about how tariffs work are flatly wrong. For starters, since the cost is frequently passed on to consumers, in practical speak, tariffs are taxes. And an analysis by the non-partisan Tax Foundation of some of the tariffs Trump applied in his first term is damning: Trump instigated a trade war by imposing new tariffs (taxes) on imports of washing machines and solar panels…steel and aluminum…and billions of dollars’ worth of consumer, intermediate, and capital goods from China…throughout 2018 and 2019. Based on levels of trade before the tariffs went into effect, the new levies amounted to a tax increase of $80 billion a year. And while tariffs can increase federal government income, budget analysts widely agree even massive tariff hikes would come nowhere near replacing the taxes Trump has targeted. Trade experts broadly say the new tariffs Trump wants to slap on the US’ biggest trading partners – China, Mexico, Canada and perhaps scores of other countries – could raise prices on televisions, smartphones, household appliances, furniture, clothing, cement, sporting goods, medicine and many more products. Analysts at the Yale Budget Lab predict Trump’s new tariffs, if fully realized, could decrease the purchasing power of the average American family by $1,200 annually. Yet Trump, who often says he trusts his gut over anything else, brushes aside the critiques. When asked about the cost consumers paid for his last term tariffs, he bristles. “They cost Americans nothing,” he said in that December NBC interview. “They made a great economy for us.” In the days after his victory, that steamroller approach is applied to all his big priorities. His promise to sweep up and deport 11-20 million undocumented immigrants (Team Trump widely disputes the lower, established number) is short on details and long on questions: How will these people be found? Where will they be held? How fast will this happen and how much will it cost? But Trump proclaims his first-day-in-office goal as if it is the easiest thing in the world: “I want to close the border,” he says. And his newly named border czar Tom Homan acts almost as cavalier. In his more nuanced moments, he suggests he will first go after dangerous criminals who have entered illegally. But he also feeds Trump’s MAGA base with attacks on the idea of sanctuary cities and calls for families fearful of being split up by the Trump plan to self-deport en masse. “They put themselves in the position. We didn’t,” he tells CNN’s Kaitlan Collins. And despite the myriad challenges, Homan, like Trump, steadily talks this up as possibly the largest deportation in US history. “I got a message to the millions of illegal aliens that Joe Biden has released into our country … you better start packing now,” he said at a rally. Amid all the frenzy of planning in Florida, perhaps no players are viewed more curiously and skeptically than Trump’s picks for remaking the government itself: the richest man in the world, Tesla and SpaceX impresario Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Those two have been chosen to head what Team Trump calls the Department of Government Efficiency. The DOGE duo initially promised to slash $2 trillion from the federal budget – almost a third of it – by eliminating waste, unnecessary jobs, regulations the administration sees as needless or counterproductive, and frankly who knows what else? For the MAGA nation, cutting big bad Washington down to size is a key tenet of their movement. At its core, DOGE is the tip of the spear for taking out bureaucrats. Many knowledgeable DC hands consider such people the backbone of the government. But in his first term, Trump was clearly irritated by workers he saw as constantly citing regulations, laws and customs that thwarted his instincts – the so-called Deep State. On X, Musk has railed: “The power of the unelected Federal bureaucracy has grown to become an unconstitutional ‘FOURTH BRANCH’ of government! Especially with the creation of their own internal court system, it has become the most powerful branch of government. We must fix this!” Critics suggest the two men don’t know what they’re talking about. A massive share of federal spending is not merely protected by law but legally required on programs like Social Security and Medicare. There is simply no way DOGE can come even close to their wish list of cuts, according to California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren. “The impoundment of funds that have been appropriated by the Congress is unconstitutional and illegal.” Furthermore, she adds, “There is no such ‘Department of Government Efficiency.’ It’s made up. So good luck to ’em.” None of the pushback seems to slow the whirlwind, leaving Democrats more dismayed by the day. But then, their party is reckoning with other issues too. “A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results.” The day after the voting, Kamala Harris is finally onstage at Howard University, doing what Trump never did despite his defeat in 2020. She admits her dash to hold the White House for Democrats has failed. Her gathered fans are despondent. She is defiant. “While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.” It is an interesting choice of words because her party has another fight on its hands. Within hours of Harris’ speech, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who twice sought the Democratic nomination, fires a blistering shot at the party’s whole approach to the election. “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” he posts on X. “While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they’re right.” Old guard Democrats rage against Sanders’ assessment, but the blame game is underway. “The Democratic Party should have one simple mission,” California Rep. Ro Khanna says on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” “and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans — not just working-class Americans — a large slice of Americans who feel the American dream has slipped away for their families and their kids.” Some Democrats are convinced, after Harris inspired an initial blast of enthusiasm, that she retreated too quickly into safe, traditional campaigning, which was a poor match against Trump’s bombast. Some say she refused to trumpet loudly enough the accomplishments she shared with Joe Biden, while others say with so many voters wanting change, she did not push Biden far enough away – pointing to her appearance on ABC’s “The View” when asked if she would have done anything differently over the past four years. “There is not a thing that comes to mind,” Harris said, “and I’ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had an impact.” “They blew it,” says CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, who sees a host of problems and a standout issue that sank Democratic hopes. He cites a Gallup poll showing how 28% of voters wanted to decrease immigration in 2020, but now the number stands at 55%. “The first big error was the Biden administrations’ blindness to the collapse of the immigration system and the chaos at the border,” he says. “They missed a massive shift in American public opinion in just a few years.” Others say the bias against female and minority candidates played a role, or that the deluge of criminal cases against Trump triggered sympathy, or that anger over violence in Gaza suppressed votes that might have favored Harris. For Democrats, untangling the possibilities is painful and more so because Harris lost to a candidate so many Americans have told pollsters is deeply flawed, mistrusted and disliked. Legendary Democratic campaign guru James Carville, who had predicted a solid win by Harris, comes on CNN to admit his mistake and to talk about what must come next. “It’s very depressing,” he says, “but if you’re doing political strategy, you know, if you have an airplane crash, you’ve got to go back and find out what went wrong. You don’t say, well, let’s just forget about it and move on.” For Van Jones, a CNN senior political commentator, some of the blame belongs to misplaced mechanics. Harris relied too much on a traditional plan of door knocks, TV commercials, and phone calls, he says, while Trump went rogue – flooding the internet with memes, pumping nonstop clickbait into millions of cell phones, and wallowing in non-traditional campaign stops such as that three-hour interview with Joe Rogan. “We were making fun of Donald Trump for having thrown away his ground game and doing some weird stuff online,” Jones says. “We thought they were idiots. It turns out we were the idiots.” Then again, some political observers wonder if the party might be over-correcting, because while Republicans are hailing their victory as monumental, the raw numbers tell a different story. “I wrote them down and I have them on my bulletin board,” says CNN’s Acosta, pointing to the scrap of paper with scribbled figures tacked up behind his desk. They show Trump’s total margin for victory in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin was just under 230,000 total votes out of more than 152 million cast across the country. Far less than 1%. “Had Kamala Harris won those states, she would have won the Electoral College, and she would have won the presidency.” But of course, that is not what happened. Trump took every battleground and expanded his support in almost every demographic, including some where Democrats least expected it. Minorities, especially Latinos, drifted toward him over immigration and the economy, the very issues the Republicans at Mar-a-Lago are preparing to attack now. Young men bought into what many Democratic analysts had dismissed as Trump’s hyper-masculine pandering. Red rural areas bent hard into their support, while unexpected shares of suburban and urban voters tilted toward Trump too. He didn’t win in every district or state, but he boosted his numbers and blunted Harris’ almost across the board. Her metrics expanded beyond Biden’s only among college-educated women. Still, the race remained close. Sorting through all the math to determine where Democrats truly lost ground and Republicans truly gained will take time. “There’s some things we don’t fully know yet,” Harris strategist Dan Kanninen says as he warns against anyone holding too firmly on to the early assessments of what went wrong for his candidate. “The real person-by-person data that tells you, ‘Did you actually have a spike?’ That’s not really going to be in place for Democratic campaigns and the voter action network until February or March.” That data may reveal that Trump re-aligned the electorate, or Kanninen notes, those numbers may show the race was pretty much a coin toss even at the end. Another former Harris adviser, Ashley Etienne, is also not convinced the Democratic position was poisonous. “We don’t have to throw away the baby with the bathwater,” she says as she sorts through other possible factors. “Was it a message issue? Was it a candidate issue?” Perhaps, she argues, the ousting of the incumbent party in the White House was a relic of the long tail of the Covid pandemic. Or maybe Trump was just the right figure at the right moment with the right message – much like Barack Obama. “This is a little provocative,” she says, stinging from the loss but, like Harris, looking for a way to not concede the fight. “I think you study Trump. There is something to be learned from what he was able to do. Trump is more sophisticated, more astute, and more strategic than we give him credit for.” All the woulda-coulda-shoulda by Democrats is just background noise for the incoming Republican juggernaut. Perhaps not even that. From the GOP vantage, the razor-thin election margins, anxiety about Trump triggering a whole new level of government dysfunction, and fears about the careening chaos of his ever-shifting worldviews are nothing. The fact he won is everything. Even all their hand-wringing over election security has vanished in the smoke of victory. For the swirling storm of people around Trump as he prepares to move north from his exile in Florida and set up residence in the White House again, this is not the time for looking back, but for leaning forward, staffing up and drafting executive orders to batter the status quo. Where others see a date on the calendar – Monday, January 20, 2025 – Trump’s true believers see a day of reckoning when a vast share of political power in the most powerful nation on Earth will fall into their hands. Trump will soon be inaugurated once again, the nation of their imaginings will be reborn, and this time it seems nothing can stop them."
Special counsel report condemns Trump’s ‘criminal efforts to retain power’ in 2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/politics/special-counsel-smith-report-trump-2020-election-subversion/index.html,"Attorney General Merrick Garland has publicly released special counsel Jack Smith’s report on his investigation into Donald Trump and efforts to overturn the 2020 election, detailing the president-elect’s “criminal efforts to retain power” and projecting confidence in the investigation. The more than 130-page report, which was submitted to Congress and released early Tuesday after a court hold blocking its release expired at midnight, spells out in extensive — if largely already known — detail how Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election. Smith’s team states in no uncertain terms that they believed Trump criminally attempted to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election results. “As set forth in the original and superseding indictments, when it became clear that Mr. Trump had lost the election and that lawful means of challenging the election results had failed, he resorted to a series of criminal efforts to retain power,” the report states. The transmission of Smith’s January 6 findings came after the president-elect and his allies were unable to stop the department from releasing it. Their court maneuverings did, however, slow the report’s release as the clock ticks toward Trump’s January 20 inauguration, as well as upend the department’s plans to release volume two, which covers the classified documents investigation. The attorney general has decided not to publicly release that second volume of the report after the special counsel recommended against its publication. Volume one of Smith’s report marks the special counsel’s final official word on his investigation into January 6, 2021, and the actions by Trump and his associates before then to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power. It contains a factual recitation of Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, including his “pressure on state officials,” the “fraudulent electors plan,” his “pressure on the Vice President” Mike Pence, and a section on how Trump’s supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6. In effect, it mirrors the landmark federal election subversion indictment that Smith brought against Trump in 2023, retooled in 2024 after the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, and ultimately withdrew after Trump’s victory in the November election. “Until Mr. Trump obstructed it, this democratic process had operated in a peaceful and orderly manner for more than 130 years,” Smith wrote, referring to Congress’ certification of the Electoral College results, under the Electoral Count Act of 1887. When it came to his duty as special counsel and the work of investigating and prosecuting Trump, Smith wrote that his “office had one north star, to follow the facts and law wherever they led. Nothing more and nothing less.” Of the failed prosecution of Trump, Smith said that prosecutors “cannot control outcomes” and can only do their jobs “the right way for the right reasons.” The final decision to prosecute the former president, he said, was his alone. “It is a decision I stand behind fully,” Smith wrote. “To have done otherwise on the facts developed during our work would have been to shirk my duties as a prosecutor and a public servant.” Smith concluded that while the Justice Department interprets the Constitution as not allowing the prosecution of a sitting president, his office “assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.” Trump, for his part, slammed the special counsel’s report as “fake findings” in overnight posts on his Truth Social network. “Jack is a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election, which I won in a landslide,” the president-elect wrote in part. “THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN!!!” Smith brought four charges against Trump in the 2020 election probe. But the case suffered setbacks culminating in the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling last summer that set a very high bar for prosecuting a former president for his conduct in office. The special counsel dropped the case against Trump altogether after voters in November decided to return him to the White House. In a private letter to Garland on January 7, made public as part of the report, Smith condemned Trump’s claim of complete exoneration as false and said his office “stands fully behind” the merits of the criminal cases that he filed. Smith had been responding to a prior letter from Trump’s lawyers, in which they claimed he was fully exonerated because Smith withdrew both criminal cases after the election. “Mr. Trump’s letter claims that dismissal of his criminal cases signifies Mr. Trump’s ‘complete exoneration.’ That is false,” Smith wrote to Garland. Smith continued: “The (Justice) Department’s view that the Constitution prohibits Mr. Trump’s indictment and prosecution while he is in office is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government’s proof, or the merits of the prosecution — all of which the Office stands fully behind.” The special counsel’s office weighed bringing an insurrection charge against Trump but decided against doing so, with the scant case law for such a prosecution a major factor in that decision. While courts have been describing the US Capitol assault as an “insurrection,” the special counsel’s office was “aware of the litigation risk that would be presented by employing this long-dormant statute.” Of particular concern was that the special counsel couldn’t find a past case of prosecuting someone “inciting, assisting, or giving aid or comfort to rebellion or insurrection.” Instead, the rare, previous prosecutions dealt with someone who directly engaged in an insurrection, according to the report. Smith said of the evidence against Trump: “However strong the proof that he incited or gave aid and comfort to those who attacked the Capitol, application of those theories of liability would also have been a first.” Smith’s office also looked at other possible charges, according to the report. The prosecutors opted against a charge alleging conspiracy to impede or injure an officer of the United States because of insufficient proof that the co-conspirators “specifically agreed to threaten force or intimidation against federal officers.” A charge under the Anti-Riot Act was considered but not brought, Smith said, pointing to how that statute has been winnowed down by courts. Trump was ultimately charged with four counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of an official proceeding. The report details how the special counsel and his team considered possible defenses that Trump might raise in court over his conduct around January 6, before they presented the indictment to a grand jury. Those arguments included that Trump might claim “he acted in good faith when he sought to stop the transfer of presidential power because he genuinely believed that outcome-determinative fraud had undermined the election’s integrity and caused him to lose.” Instead, the special counsel wrote, Trump knowingly worked to deceive others – an effort that “was pervasive throughout the charged conspiracies.” “This was not a case in which Mr. Trump merely misstated a fact or two in a handful of isolated instances,” Smith wrote. “On a repeated basis, he and co-conspirators used specific and knowingly false claims of election fraud in his calls and meetings with state officials, in an effort to induce them to overturn the results of the election in their states.” Smith also wrote that any argument Trump was merely following the advice of his attorneys wouldn’t hold up because the attorneys were involved in the alleged criminal conduct and Trump was not relying on them for advice but rather as people who could provide legal cover for his efforts. Addressing the potential argument that Trump was exercising his rights to free speech, Smith wrote that because Trump used “knowingly false statements regarding specific facts to commit the crimes charged…they were not protected by the First Amendment.” Following his indictment in the case, Trump’s targeting of witnesses through posts on social media presented “a significant challenge,” Smith wrote. Trump was ultimately placed under a gag order after extensive court filings from Smith detailing his posts and comments on individuals involved in the case, including the judge overseeing the case. “Mr. Trump’s resort to intimidation and harassment during the investigation was not new, as demonstrated by his actions during the charged conspiracies,” Smith wrote. Smith called the effort of using social media to “publicly attack and seek to influence” people, including state and federal officials, judges and election workers, “a fundamental component” of his conduct “underlying the charges in the Election Case.” “After Mr. Trump publicly assailed these individuals, threats and harassment from his followers inevitably followed,” Smith wrote, adding that “the same pattern transpired after Mr. Trump’s indictment.” The special counsel said his office would not have prosecuted Trump if he was merely exercising his free speech rights by engaging in “exaggeration or rough-and-tumble politics.” The prosecutor also described Trump’s alleged conduct as going beyond challenging the election results in court. “The conduct of Mr. Trump and co-conspirators, however, went well beyond speaking their minds or contesting the election results though our legal system,” Smith said in his report. “Instead, Mr. Trump targeted a key federal government function – the process by which the United States collects, counts, and certifies the results of the presidential election – and sought to obstruct or defeat it through fraud and deceit.” Over the course of more than 20 pages, Smith laid out why he believed the unprecedented prosecution was justified, while arguing there was no alternative to a federal criminal prosecution for holding Trump accountable. Not only was there “considerable federal interest in protecting the integrity of the United States’ electoral process” that “weighed in favor of proceeding,” Smith said in explaining his decision to bring charges, there was “federal interest defending from future harm the United States’ exceptional tradition of peaceful transitions of presidential power.” He pointed to other interests that he said justified the prosecution, including protecting election officials from violence, counting every citizen’s vote and the “evenhanded administration of law.” “To date, more than 1,500 people have been criminally charged for their roles in the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol,” Smith said, speaking to the need for an evenhanded administration of the law. “With that in mind, Mr. Trump’s relative culpability weighed heavily in favor of charging him, as the individual most responsible for what occurred at the Capitol on January 6.” At the time of his indictment, Smith noted, the Georgia election subversion case against Trump had not been brought, and once it had, it did not “fully address” Trump’s election-related conduct. Moreover, even if the impeachment proceeding against Trump had resulted in a conviction by the Senate, that would not have been sufficient to address the federal interest, Smith said. As part of the 2020 election subversion probe, federal investigators interviewed more than 250 witnesses and brought more than 55 people to testify before a grand jury, according to the report. That includes interviews conducted during Smith’s tenure and before the probe became a special counsel investigation in late 2023. Investigators also examined “voluminous records,” including emails, text messages, encrypted messages and other documents, which they obtained in some cases through search warrants and subpoenas. They reviewed more than one terabyte of data from public sources, including social media platforms. After charging Trump, the special counsel’s office had continued to investigate the unindicted co-conspirators, Smith said in his report. The office found evidence that one subject of the investigation, who was not named, may have committed unrelated crimes, and that investigation was referred to a US attorney’s office, according to the report. In the federal election probe, the special counsel ultimately did not bring additional indictments, even as the prosecutors had made a “preliminary determination” that charges against “certain” co-conspirators could be justified. “This Report should not be read to allege that any particular person other than Mr. Trump committed a crime, nor should it be read to exonerate any particular person,” the report said. Before dropping the case against Trump, the office had begun a discussion over whether potential charges against additional co-conspirators would be brought in Trump’s case or in a separate case. “Because the Office reached no final conclusions and did not seek indictments against anyone other than Mr. Trump – the head of the criminal conspiracies and their intended beneficiary – this Report does not elaborate further on the investigation and preliminary assessment of uncharged individuals,” Smith said. The special counsel team, Smith said, went out of its way not to interfere with the 2024 election by abiding by longstanding Justice Department policies for how to handle investigations during an election year. The note marks an implicit rebuttal to Trump’s oft-repeated claim that the probe itself, the indictment and the potential trial were all part of an “election interference” effort by liberal prosecutors who were trying to defeat his campaign. “Throughout its work, the Office was focused entirely on its mandate to uphold the law, and nothing more,” the report said. “The career prosecutors in the Office conducted its investigation and prosecution in a manner that complied fully with the Department’s policies regarding election year sensitivities.” The report said Smith’s team consulted regularly with the Public Integrity Section within the Justice Department, which oversees cases involving public officials, including on details like when to propose trial dates that wouldn’t interfere with the election. “Collectively, prosecutors in the Office had many years of experience providing training, advice, and guidance to prosecutors and law enforcement agents throughout the Department on how to comply with the Department’s election-related policies,” the report said. An appendix of the report contains a series of previously undisclosed, combative letters sent by Smith’s team and Trump’s lawyers as they wrangled in recent days over the public release of the report. Trump’s lawyers sent a letter to Garland on January 6, demanding that Smith “terminate all efforts towards the preparation and release of” his report. They claimed that Smith was trying to “perpetuate false and discredited accusations” against Trump by releasing the report, and they called him an “out-of-control private citizen unconstitutionally posing as a prosecutor,” citing US District Judge Aileen Cannon’s ruling that Smith’s appointment as special counsel was unlawful. Smith penned his own letter to Garland on January 7, rebutting the Trump letter. Smith’s response accuses Trump’s lawyers, including his nominee for deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, of making a “variety of false, misleading, or otherwise unfounded claims.” The special counsel also pointed out that Trump’s letter “fails to identify any specific factual objections to the draft” report that they reviewed in the past several weeks, ahead of its public release. “Mr. Trump recycles his baseless allegation that the Office’s work constituted a partisan attack, a claim flatly rejected by the only court to have ruled on it,” Smith wrote in the letter to Garland, referring to an August 2024 ruling from federal Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, DC, in the election subversion case. A hearing on volume two of Smith’s report is set for later this week in Florida. Garland does not intend to release that portion of the report publicly, but he had planned to allow a very small group of lawmakers to view it behind closed doors. Cannon, however, extended an order that prevents him from sharing that volume to anyone outside of the department. This story has been updated with additional details."

"Grammys and Oscars to proceed amid LA fires, but will put the spotlight on first responders",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/entertainment/oscars-grammys-award-season-la-wildfires/index.html,"As they say in Hollywood, the show must go on. On Monday, it was announced that both the Grammys and Oscars would proceed as planned on February 2 and March 2, respectively, answering a question that has been debated behind the scenes by decision makers tasked with figuring out how to proceed with award season as Los Angeles grapples with devastating wildfires. Some stars, like Jean Smart and Patricia Arquette, have called for award shows to be cancelled or re-focused as charitable telethons to raise funds for the fires. Award season – the Golden Globes, Grammys, SAG Awards, Oscars and more – is a glitzy time in Hollywood. Watching well-paid stars take the stage to collect awards while thousands of LA families are displaced and have lost their homes runs the risk of being tone deaf, but economically, these shows also provide income for thousands of entertainment workers from caterers to drivers to lighting professionals who are integral to the industry. The Grammys are the first show to announce they will proceed amid the wildfires, but the show will be reimagined to put the spotlight on first responders and also will include a charitable component. “In challenging times, music has the power to heal, comfort, and unite like nothing else,” Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. and chair of the board of Trustees Tammy Hurt said in a letter to Recording Academy members on Monday. “The Grammys will not only honor the artistry and achievements of our music community but also serve as a platform to amplify the spirit of resilience that defines this great city of Los Angeles.” The letter said that the show will proceed as planned in close coordination with local authorities to “ensure public safety and responsible use of area resources,” and that the ceremony will “carry a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.” Last week, the Recording Academy and its charitable arm, MusiCares, launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with an initial $1 million donation to support music creatives and professionals. Now, with additional contributions, the find has distributed more than $2 million in emergency aid and will continue its ongoing efforts. The Grammys are the next major televised award show to air on February 2. The Critics Choice Awards on E! were set to be hosted by Chelsea Handler on January 12 in Santa Monica – an area close to the Palisades fire – but were postponed last week. They are currently set to take place at the end of January. The Oscars has a longer timeline to determine next steps. The show is currently set to proceed on March 2, the Academy announced on Monday. Oscars voting has also now been extended through January 17, and the nominations announcement has been rescheduled for January 23 and will be held virtually instead of in-person. (Last week, the Academy had already pushed back the voting window and nominations.) The Oscars nominees luncheon, where nominees are feted, has been cancelled this year. “We are all devastated by the impact of the fires and the profound losses experienced by so many in our community. The Academy has always been a unifying force within the film industry, and we are committed to standing together in the face of hardship,” Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang, said in a letter to members on Monday. “Our members always share how important it is for us to come together as a community, and we are determined to use this opportunity to celebrate our resilient and compassionate industry,” the letter added. “We also look forward to honoring our frontline workers who have aided with the fires, recognizing those impacted, and encouraging people to join the Academy in supporting the relief efforts.” As CNN reported last week, many key award season events have been postponed. The annual AFI Awards luncheon, which was set to be held on January 10, will be rescheduled, and the annual BAFTA Tea Party was cancelled. Over the weekend, the Producers Guild Awards postponed their nominations announcement for the second time “out of care and concern for those being affected by the fires.” And on Monday, the Writers Guild Awards postponed their nominations “until further notice” due to the ongoing fires, the organization said in a statement to CNN. The Screen Actors Guild Awards are scheduled for February 23. Last week, the actors’ union donated $1 million to the SAG-AFTRA Foundation for fire relief."
Heidi Montag’s music tops iTunes charts after ‘Hills’ alum loses home in LA wildfire,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/entertainment/heidi-montag-itunes-wildfire/index.html,"Days after “The Hills” alums Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt lost their home in the Palisades Fire, Montag’s followers are showing up to support her by streaming her music. Montag’s 2010 song and album “Superficial” claimed the No. 1 spot on iTunes’ charts Monday, with Bad Bunny’s DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS album trailing Montag in the No. 2 spot. “Thank you so much to everyone who’s making my song number one itunes, number one in several different countries,” Montag said in a video posted to her Instagram story Monday. “Thank you, thank you, thank you for going harder for us, for our family. God bless you all.” The milestone comes after Pratt had been asking supporters on his TikTok page to help them earn money by streaming Montag’s track, and it seems their call was heeded. “Everyone made this happen!” Pratt celebrated on his Instagram page Monday. “You have no idea how much this means. Thank you. Keep streaming it, keep buying it.” The couple, who became ubiquitous with pop culture of the aughts, rose to fame on the Southern California-based reality show “The Hills.” They have been documenting their experience over the past week as they were evacuated from their home, later learning that it has been destroyed in the deadly wildfire. Pratt said his parents’ home also burned in the fire. High winds have propelled multiple ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles County, including the Palisades Fire on LA’s West side and the Eaton Fire, which is on LA’s East side in the neighborhood of Altadena. At least 24 people have died and dozens are still missing, authorities said. The coastal Palisades Fire is considered the most destructive ever in LA County. It is over 23,000 acres and was at least 14% contained as of Monday afternoon, according to Cal Fire. Officials said on Sunday that while progress has been made, the fire threat will remain “very high” as dangerous Santa Ana winds return this week."
"Pay a song for me: ‘Mr. Tambourine Man’ lyrics among Bob Dylan song drafts, artworks and photos to go on sale",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/entertainment/bob-dylan-tambourine-man-auction-aronowitz-intl/index.html,"A spectacular haul of Bob Dylan memorabilia, including early drafts of the singer and songwriter’s number 1 hit “Mr. Tambourine Man” and an original oil painting, will soon go under the hammer. Fans and collectors alike will be able to bid for 50 “extraordinary artifacts” from the musician’s life and career, with some items expected to fetch up to $600,000, according to Julien’s Auctions, which is selling the items. Others are valued at around $100. The items being sold form part of the personal collection of journalist Al Aronowitz, commonly known as the “godfather of rock journalism,” who became friends with many of the stars he reported on, including Dylan, the auction house said. Among the items are multiple pieces of original art, including a signed oil painting from 1968, and an analogue disc of the singer’s 2021 re-recording of “The Times They Are A-Changin,” one of his most famous songs which was released in 1964. A promotional leaflet for Dylan’s first major solo concert in 1963 at Town Hall in New York City and multiple vintage photos of the singer are also for sale. Perhaps the most eye-catching listing however is three drafts of “Mr. Tambourine Man” – the first Bob Dylan composition to get to number 1 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Dylan perfected the lyrics while staying at the Aronowitz family home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, while listening to Marvin Gaye’s “Can I Get A Witness” on repeat, according to the auction house, which added that the pages are estimated to sell for between $400,000 and $600,000. In an article written by Aronowitz – an original copy of which is also up for sale – the journalist recalls Dylan writing the lyrics in his home. Aronowitz said that Dylan wrote the song on a portable typewriter in a swirl of cigarette smoke, “his bony, long-nailed fingers tapping the words out on my stolen, canary-colored Saturday Evening Post copy paper.” Later, Aronowitz said that he found “a waste basket full of crumpled false starts,” according to excerpts of the article posted on the auction house website. “I took the crumpled sheets, smoothed them out, read the crazy leaping lines, smiled to myself at the leaps that never landed and then put the sheets into a file folder.” The auction house added that “the pages show substantial changes from the first draft to the third draft, which is close to the final version of the song, although it still has significant variations from the final lyrics.” “Don’t miss your chance to own a piece of history,” it said. Aronowitz’s son, Myles, said his father, who died in 2005, was “much more than a journalist, he understood what these artists were trying to do.” “The collection represents my father’s instinctive ability to identify and connect with greatness. Each item is evidence of this, and how with his magic, he literally brought you into the room,” he said in a statement. Singer Judy Collins previously said that Dylan wrote the song at the house of impresario Albert Grossman. “I heard this voice coming up the stairs and it was Dylan writing ‘Tambourine Man,’” she told the Strange Brew Podcast in 2023. “So, I got my robe on, I went downstairs and I sat for two hours in front of this blue door behind which Dylan was writing Tambourine Man.” The auction, titled “Celebrating Bob Dylan: The Al Aronowitz Archive, T Bone Burnett, & More,” is taking place at the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee on January 18. The sale coincides with James Mangold’s Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown” hitting cinemas across the world. Starring Timothée Chalamet as Dylan, the film follows the musician’s spectacular rise from his arrival in New York at age 19 to become one of the most influential singers and songwriters of all time. In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for “having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” He has sold more than 125 million records during his career."
Will Ferrell’s reason for dressing up as Buddy the Elf will shock no one: ‘Occasionally I just like to do weird things’,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/entertainment/will-ferrell-buddy-the-elf-reason/index.html,"Christmas might be over, but we’re still thinking about that moment from long-ago December when Will Ferrell inexplicably dressed up as one of his most iconic characters. Now he’s explaining why he did. On Friday’s episode of the “New Heights” podcast with brothers Travis and Jason Kelce, Ferrell discussed his thinking behind his decision to dress up as Buddy – the usually chipper elf from his now-classic 2003 holiday film “Elf” – at an LA Kings hockey game at Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena on December 29. “I get these weird ideas every now and then,” he told the Kelce brothers, later adding, “I told my wife, ‘Over the break, it would be funny if I just got a Buddy the Elf costume and didn’t shave for like a week, and I’m just sitting there with a candy cigarette and I’m just gonna sit there for a period and see how people react.’ And that was it.” Ferrell clearly committed to the stunt, as pictures from the game display him scowling and sporting a five o’clock shadow, drinking a beer and ‘smoking’ a faux cigarette. “Buddy the Elf got laid off, I think, from the North Pole,” Ferrell said on the podcast this week of his motivation for Buddy’s downtrodden vibe, adding, “He’s having a pull from his beer, smoking a cig.” “Elf” was directed by Marvel and “Star Wars” maestro Jon Favreau and starred Ferrell, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenbergen and Peter Dinklage, along with the late James Cann, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart. The film became an instant holiday classic, and follows Buddy, who was raised among Santa’s elves in the North Pole, as he searches for his real father in New York City. The funnyman wasn’t expecting the reaction he got from his “Elf”-related lark. “The reaction was insane!” Ferrell said. “Like, ‘What is he doing? Is he promoting something?’ But occasionally I just like to do weird things like that just to stir it up.” Keep stirring, Buddy. CNN’s Alli Rosenbloom contributed to this report."
Dave Coulier says chemotherapy for his cancer treatment is like ‘a roller coaster ride’,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/entertainment/dave-coulier-chemotherapy-cancer-roller-coaster/index.html,"Dave Coulier is discussing his experience fighting cancer. On the latest episode of the “Full House Rewind” podcast, the “Fuller House” star, 65, shared more about the side effects of his treatment for stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer. “It’s been kind of a roller coaster ride. Different effects,” he said. “And people who are watching the show or listening to the show, who have been here before, you know that it’s a roller coaster, because the side effects have side effects, and then you take a drug to counteract that and this and that.” He added that “it’s this constant cocktail where your body is in fight or flight mode, and you’re just trying to adjust to, like, ‘Okay, how am I adjusting to steroids? How am I adjusting to the chemo cocktail? And then, how am I adjusting to all these other things?’” Coulier continued to say that his body is “in a fight. It’s a little bit of an internal battle.” According to the American Cancer Society, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is one of the most common cancers in the US, accounting for about 4% of all cancers. The actor initially shared the news of his diagnosis in November, during an interview on “Today.” He told the show’s co-anchor Hoda Kotb at the time that he had been diagnosed five weeks prior. Coulier said he has “B cell lymphoma,” which he described as “aggressive.” “The onset of this growing lymphoma in my groin area was very quick so I said ‘Something’s not right, I have a golf ball down here,’” he told Kotb. “And so we biopsed it, we took it out, and they said ‘You know, we wish we had better news for you, but you have B cell lymphoma, we need to get you into chemotherapy right away.’” This week, Coulier told his former “Fuller House” costar Marla Sokoloff on the podcast that opening up about his journey has been a positive, largely because it has helped to spread awareness about cancer detection and treatment. “I have heard from so many people, Marla, who have been affected by cancer in their lives. And, you know, the words of encouragement have, I think, really helped people. So that, to me, is worth the journey of all of this,” he shared. “If I have to feel a little out of sorts for a few months, then, then so be it,” Coulier also said. “But just being able to alert people that it’s okay to get a colonoscopy, or early screenings, or a mammogram, it’s really worth it.” “Early detection means everything, and for so many people it can save your life, which is remarkable.” CNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed to this report."
Rams roll to emotional victory over the Vikings to advance to divisional round showdown in Philly,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/sport/nfl-rams-defeat-vikings-in-arizona-spt/index.html,"The Los Angeles Rams paid tribute Monday night to the first responders and those impacted by the ongoing deadly wildfires in Southern California during the Rams 27-9 wild-card victory over the Minnesota Vikings. The NFL moved the game from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, to State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the home of the Arizona Cardinals, due to the fire threat. Before kickoff, the Rams’ mascot, Rampage, along with the Cardinals flag crew, ran onto the field with “LA Together” flags. A moment of silent reflection was later held for the victims of the wildfire prior to the National Anthem being played. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said it was important for the league to support the city of Los Angeles. “One of the things we wanted to do by playing this game tonight is send that message to the people back in Los Angeles that the NFL, this community, every community in this nation and around the world are there to support them, rooting for them and is going to be part of bringing LA back,” Goodell said in an ESPN interview prior to the contest. “This will be a celebration, honoring the people who are out there really fighting the fight.” The Rams donned custom Los Angeles Fire Department hats and shirts with the team logo on them and “Thank You Firefighters and First Responders” banners were displayed in the south end zone. To make the Rams feel at home, the Cardinals organization painted the field and end zone in the Rams’ blue and yellow colors. Arizona also provided two Boeing 777 planes to pick up 400 Rams players, coaches, personnel, their families and pets, according to the ESPN broadcast. Goodell said about 45,000 Rams fans made the trip. Former Rams captain and 2022 Super Bowl champion Andrew Whitworth thanked the first responders and shared an impassioned message to the Los Angeles community. “I believe in the people of Los Angeles. We are strong. We will not be defined by this devastation,” the 2021 Walter Payton NFL Man of the year told the crowd before the game. “We will rebuild LA hand in hand together, for as long as it takes.” As for the final contest of the wild-card round, the Rams jumped out early, scoring on their first two possessions —a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to running back Kyren Williams and on a Joshua Karty 34-yard field goal — to take a 10-0 first quarter lead. Up 10-3 in the second quarterback, Rams cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon sacked Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold causing him to fumble. Rookie linebacker Jared Verse scooped the ball up and took it 57 yards for the touchdown. Four minutes later, LA would extend its lead when Stafford threw his second TD of the game, a 13-yarder to tight end Davis Allen. The Rams’ defense gave Minnesota havoc in the first half as it sacked Darnold six times and forced two turnovers, one resulting in a touchdown. The Rams led 24-3 at the half. In the fourth quarter, Vikings linebacker Michael Hoecht and rookie defensive tackle Braden Fiske sacked Darnold for the team’s seventh of the game. Afterward, Hoecht honored his city by throwing up the “LA” sign. Los Angeles would sack Darnold nine times on the night to tie an NFL playoff record. After the game, Stafford addressed the obstacles the team overcame. “We knew what we were playing for today. It was go get this win but this is for the people of Los Angeles, struggling right now. It’s unbelievable to watch the whole community, the state, the country get behind them. It’s a tough time to be back there,” Stafford said. “We’re just happy we came out and played like this tonight to give us something to be happy about.” He added: “It was a tough week for us, a bunch of moving parts. Our organization did a hell of a job taken care of us. … It’s been a whirlwind.” The Rams will face the Philadelphia Eagles in the divisional round at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on Sunday at 3 p.m. ET."

Daniil Medvedev destroys a camera in outburst during tough Australian Open victory,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/sport/daniil-medvedev-destroys-camera-australian-open-spt-intl/index.html,"Daniil Medvedev used his racket to smash a camera attached to the net during a tricky opening round win at this year’s Australian Open. The world No. 5 eventually beat Thailand’s Kasidit Samrej in five sets – 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 – but had grown increasingly frustrated against an opponent ranked 418th in the world. It all boiled over for Medvedev at the end of the third set, with Samrej serving to take a 2-1 lead in the match. During a tense point, Samrej got lucky when his shot clipped the net, forcing Medvedev to change direction and sprint for the ball. The Russian star got there in time, but, now off balance, couldn’t do anything about Samrej’s cross-court winner that followed. As Samrej apologized for his fortunate shot, Medvedev took his frustration out on a small camera positioned in the center of the net, breaking both the camera and his racket in the outburst. The chair umpire subsequently gave Medvedev a warning for racket abuse. The 2021 US Open champion went on to lose the third set as Samrej, a wildcard for this tournament, took a step closer to the biggest win of his career at his debut grand slam event. However, it wasn’t to be for the 23-year-old with Medvedev recovering his composure to claim a tense five-set victory. Speaking during his post-match interview on court, Medvedev appeared to be in good spirits and didn’t mention his outburst at the end of the third set. Instead, he said how surprised he had been by the level of his opponent. “If he plays like this every match, his life can be good – money, girls, casino, whatever,” he joked. “I wish he could play like this every match.” Medvedev, a three-time finalist and last year’s runner-up at the Australian Open, will now face 19-year-old American player Learner Tien in the second round."

The close, back-and-forth game ended on an incredible game-winning field goal that doinked off the upright and bounced through to give the Commanders a 23-20 upset over the NFC South Division champions. The first round of the playoffs wrapped up Monday night with the Los Angeles Rams rolling over the Minnesota Vikings for an emotional victory after a week of devastation from the wildfires sweeping Southern California. The games next week: Houston-Kansas City at 4:30 pm ET on Saturday, Washington-Detroit at 8 pm ET on Saturday, Rams-Eagles at 3 pm ET on Sunday and Ravens-Bills at 6:30 pm ET on Sunday. Here are six takeaways from the opening round of the NFL playoffs: The specter of the wildfires in the Los Angeles area hung over Monday’s divisional playoff game days long before it even began. The Los Angeles Rams were the home team against the Minnesota Vikings on Monday, but the game itself was played in Phoenix – moved due to the devastation being wrought on Southern California. Emotional remembrances for the victims of the disaster marked the pregame ceremonies and the Rams themselves wore special LAFD gear on the sideline that honored the firefighters battling the blazes. Once the game got started, the emotion of the last week poured out of the Rams in the form of football dominance. The Rams jumped out early, scoring on their first two possessions —a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to running back Kyren Williams and on a Joshua Karty 34-yard field goal — to take a 10-0 first quarter lead. From there, it was a clinc. Rams cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon sacked Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold causing him to fumble in the second quarter. Rookie linebacker Jared Verse scooped the ball up and took it 57 yards to the house to make it 17-3. Four minutes later, the Rams put up another touchdown to make it 24-3. At the same time, its defense was bringing Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold back down to earth with an interception and scores of sacks. It was an impressive performance from a team that had many more off-the-field distractions than almost any other in these NFL playoffs – only the Los Angeles Chargers could really empathize with how the Rams had to prepare for this one. But unlike the Chargers, the Rams’ are still playing after their 27-9 victory on Monday night. Ultimately, sports means so little when people are losing their lives and homes to a terrible natural disaster. But for the Rams and the people of Los Angeles, Monday’s romp over the Vikings hopefully provided a little bit of respite during an unbelievably sad period. The Washington Commanders have found themselves a good one in Jayden Daniels, the rookie quarterback who outdid Tampa Bay’s Baker Mayfield in the weekend’s standout game. It was Daniels leading Washington down the field on a game-winning drive, putting the exclamation mark on an incredible game: 24-of-35 for 268 passing yards and two touchdowns while leading the team in rushing with 36 yards. Daniels was returning to the scene of his first NFL start, which ended in a brutal 37-20 loss in Week 1. But the rookie who took the field on Sunday night was a different version of the Commanders quarterback. The former LSU Tiger looked like he’d been on this stage many times before, rushing and passing as he had all season and taking control of long drives that ended in Commanders points. Mayfield, meanwhile, continued his renaissance year with another strong performance – though a couple of key mistakes cost his team. Mayfield fumbled the snap on a drive that started in Tampa territory after the Bucs defense stopped Washington on fourth down. Linebacker Bobby Wagner jumped on the ball to give the Commanders near the Bucs end zone early in the fourth quarter. That turnover turned into a Daniels touchdown pass to wide receiver Terry McLaurin to go up 20-17. Mayfield answered that drive with one of his own to tie the game, making big plays with his arm – though a miscommunication with his center on a critical third down meant that the Bucs had to go for the three points instead of pushing for a go-ahead touchdown. After that it was time for Daniels to work his magic in the final minutes, as he had nearly all season. Needing points with the score tied 20-20, Washington found themselves with a third-and-six but Daniels found wide receiver Dyami Brown for a 21-yard strike to keep the drive going. A couple plays later, it was a beauty of a pass to Austin Ekeler that put the Commanders deep in Tampa territory, allowing them to start killing the clock. The rookie out of LSU made one final game-winning play, picking up a crucial first down on third-and-short after making a man miss when it looked like he’d be stopped in the backfield. From there, it looked elementary – except when Zane Gonzalez doinked the field goal off the upright. Luckily for the Commanders, it bounced through and handed Washington a postseason upset. Washington faces a tall task next as they face the NFC top seed Detroit Lions at Ford Field next weekend. It was a defensive struggle throughout the Philadelphia Eagles’ 22-10 win over the Green Bay Packers, but the tone was set on the game’s first play. Philly linebacker Oren Burks laid the boom against kick returner Keisean Nixon, who lost control of the ball. The Eagles emerged with the ball and possession on the Green Bay 27-yard line just seconds into the game. The Eagles were up 7-0 before two minutes had run off the clock. From there, it was a physical, smashmouth game and multiple Packers had to leave the game with injuries. The Packers, already playing without top wide receiver Christian Watson after a torn ACL in his knee last week, lost their top wide receivers Romeo Doubs and Jayden Reed to a suspected concussion and an upper-body injury. Packers quarterback Jordan Love threw two interceptions that didn’t result in any Philly points but kept the Packers from establishing any sort of offensive rhythm. The game largely stayed as an exchange of punts until late in the third quarter after the Packers used a lengthy drive to get their first field goal of the game. After that, physical runs by Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert and Green Bay running back Josh Jacobs provided a bit of spark as the physicality ratcheted up even further. Goedert’s touchdown run to put the Eagles up two scores was the kind of physical, Football Play (capital F, capital P) that gets the heart going. He delivered two punishing stiff arms and a lowered shoulder to the Packers’ Carrington Valentine and rumbled into the end zone, blunting the Packers’ momentum after they had just kicked a field goal at the end of a 12-play drive. On the ensuing drive, it was Jacobs’ turn to make another Football Play, running through and over Eagles defenders for 31 yards. His shirt was stretched out behind him as defenders hung on any way they could. He was initially signaled to have gotten into the end zone but was ruled down just short of the goal line. A play later, he drove it that final yard into the end zone to get the Packers within striking range. But the tough Eagles defense would not allow the Packers to go further than their own 41-yard line on their next possession and a turnover on downs largely put the game out of reach for Green Bay. The NFL playoffs got off on a strange, weird foot. The Chargers stormed out of the gate against the Texans but couldn’t get into the end zone on their first two drives and were only up 6-0. The game stayed that way for much of the first half until a turning point that set the tone for a wild second half. Pinned at the 1-yard line at the start of the drive, Houston’s offense came to life after a broken play, in which Stroud scooped up a botched snap and – while Chargers pass rushers Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack closed in on him near the sideline – the Texans signal-caller connected with wide receiver Xavier Hutchinson for a 34-yard gain. A couple of plays later, Stroud hit wide receiver Nico Collins for a 37-yard strike, and the duo capped the 10-play, 99-yard drive with a 13-yard touchdown for the 7-6 lead. From there, it was turnover city. The Texans fumbled on the opening drive of the second half and then forced a turnover on downs on the drive on the ensuing drive. Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert suddenly got a case of the yips, throwing three second-half interceptions – he had four in the game, more than he had in the entire regular season – and the Texans turned those picks into a blowout. The Chargers got one more big play – a long touchdown pass to wide receiver Ladd McConkey – but the Texans not only blocked the extra point but then returned it all the way to the end zone for a two-point conversion. It was the first time that had ever happened in the postseason and was the final nail in the coffin for the Chargers. The final score was 32-12 in favor of Houston, which will take on the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round next weekend. Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson and running back Derrick Henry might be enough on their own to carry the Ravens deep into the playoffs – and they showed why Saturday in a 28-14 thumping of the Steelers. The thunder-and-lightning duo highlighted a Baltimore running attack that went for a team postseason-record 299 yards, pacing the Ravens to a 28-14 win over their AFC North rivals. Henry ran for 186 yards on 26 tough carries, punishing the Steeler defense repeatedly with  runs right into the teeth of the defensive line. He found the right seams, breaking for a long touchdown run and a shorter bruiser for his two scores. Jackson meanwhile was electric as only he can be. He rushed 15 times for 81 yards while also completing 16 of 21 passes for 175 yards and two touchdowns. The rowdy 70,000 fans at M&T Bank Stadium routinely serenaded their star with chants of “M-V-P!” After the game, Jackson said watching Henry run is like being in a movie – “Cars,” specifically. “You know when Lightning McQueen just flying, flashing past?” Jackson said. “That’s how Derrick looks when he’s passing all those guys. And it look like a movie, bro.” Jackson and Henry simply ran through, around and over the Steelers’ defense on a massive drive to start the game, going 95 yards to open the scoring. The biggest play of the drive was Henry taking a direct snap and finding a seam in the Steelers’ front seven, bursting for 34 yards in a play that was punctuated by a brutal stiff arm that sent Steelers star safety Minkah Fitzpatrick reeling. Head coach John Harbaugh said that play was put into the playbook specifically for this game against the Steelers. The next drive showed it would be a bruising night for Pittsburgh. It was an 85-yard, 13-play drive in the second quarter that featured exactly zero passes. It ended with Henry pounding through the tackles one more time to get into the end zone, putting an exclamation point on a physically dominating drive. It would end up being the story of the game as the Steelers never got closer than two touchdowns again. Those “M-V-P” chants rang around Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, Sunday afternoon as Bills quarterback Josh Allen showed why it’s such a tight pick between him and Jackson for the award. Allen made some truly jaw-dropping throws on Sunday against the Broncos and used his feet to pick up some key first downs in the first half as Denver jumped out to an early lead. It was a play in the third quarter that truly exemplified where Allen’s game is at right now. On fourth and short near Denver’s end zone, Buffalo decided to go for it and Allen bounced around in the pocket, scanning for a receiver. As the pass rush closed in, it looked like it may be a killer sack. But just at the last moment, Allen was able to unfurl a gorgeous pass to the back of the end zone for running back Ty Johnson, who made an equally amazing catch – sliding and managing to keep his feet inbounds – for their second touchdown connection of the afternoon. The score was the 22nd postseason passing TD of Allen’s career, surpassing Hall of Famer Jim Kelly for the most in franchise playoff history. The fourth quarter started with another touchdown pass from Allen, who connected with Curtis Samuel on a third-and-6 pass for what would have been a first down. But Samuel went one better, spinning out of a tackle and sprinting to the end zone for a brilliant 55-yard touchdown. From there, the final quarter was a formality as the Bills defeated the Broncos, 31-7. The Bills victory means that there will be an absolutely epic showdown in the divisional round next week: Allen and the Bills vs. Jackson and the Ravens. It’ll be a matchup of two leading MVP candidates who were at the top of their game during this opening round. Voting for the MVP award took place at the end of the regular season, but maybe everyone should agree that the winner of that game takes home the award?

Los Angeles’ NBA teams return home hoping to provide a distraction from destructive wildfires,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/sport/nba-lakers-clippers-return-home-wildfires-spt/index.html,"Both of Los Angeles’ NBA teams returned to their respective home courts Monday night after having games postponed due to wildfires in the area. The Los Angeles Lakers returned to Crypto.com Arena for their first home game since January 3 while the Los Angeles Clippers played their first game at Intuit Dome since January 4. The Lakers had a pair of home games postponed last Thursday and Saturday while the Clippers had a single home game postponed on Saturday. Ahead of the game against the Miami Heat, Lakers guard Gabe Vincent addressed the crowd at Crypto.com Arena. “Just wanted to take a minute to acknowledge the tragedy that LA is dealing with at this time,” the Modesto, California, native said. “I speak on behalf of my teammates, this organization, our hearts go out to all those who have been affected by it. “We definitely want to give a good shout out to the first responders who are putting their lives on the line right now to protect our communities. I think it’s important at this time that we come together as a city, as a community, as a family and help support those who are in need right now. Go Lakers!” Lakers star LeBron James wore shoes honoring the Los Angeles Fire Department. Over at Intuit Dome, prior to the Clippers’ tipoff against the San Antonio Spurs, the lights were dimmed as the public address announcer read a heartfelt statement about the devastation of the fires and the resiliency of the city as a message of “LA Strong” was displayed on the scoreboard. Although wildfires continue to threaten the Los Angeles area, members of the Clippers welcomed the opportunity to return to the court upon learning their home schedule would resume on Monday. “When people are losing their homes, kids are losing schools, losing lives, it’s very difficult to approach the game of basketball because life is bigger than basketball,” head coach Tyronn Lue said Sunday. “Hopefully we can bring some kind of joy with the game coming back tomorrow and some togetherness and try to put some smiles on people’s faces in tough times.” Clippers forward Nicolas Batum admitted Sunday that his focus had been away from basketball, but he was also in favor of Monday’s game going on as planned. “We’ve been through the crazy stuff for the last five days,” Batum said. “I think maybe people need that to get their mind off of it for two, three hours.” The LA squads’ homecoming comes on the same day the two franchises, along with 10 other professional sports organizations across Los Angeles, have pledged “a combined donation of more than $8 million” to fire victims and those battling the fires. The donation was announced in a joint statement along with the Angel City FC, the Angels, Chargers, Dodgers, Ducks, Galaxy, Kings, LAFC, Rams and Sparks. The 12 teams have also joined forces with Fanatics to distribute $3 million worth of Fanatics merchandise to LA residents who have been forced to evacuate from their homes. In addition to the apparel items being donated by Fanatics, teams are collectively contributing thousands more items such as personal hygiene kits, school supplies, sneakers that will be given out at three upcoming events. Evacuated victims of the fires with proof of residency in evacuated zip codes will be able to participate in the distribution events on January 17 between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. PT at three locations – Dodger Stadium, SoFi Stadium and BMO Stadium. Last Friday, the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association announced they are donating $1 million for “immediate relief” to several organizations aiding wildfire relief efforts, including the American Red Cross and World Central Kitchen. The Lakers announced Sunday more efforts to help out the community. Starting at Monday’s game, the team began a donation drive at their home games to “support the Los Angeles community and relief efforts for the Southern California wildfires.” Additionally, the Lakers will use their practice facility, the UCLA Health Training Center in El Segundo, California, as a drive-thru donation center beginning on Tuesday. Both the Lakers and Clippers will spend much of the rest of January at home. After Monday night’s games, the Clippers play five of their next six games at home. The Lakers will play four of their next five games at home, with their lone road game coming against the Clippers at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California."
