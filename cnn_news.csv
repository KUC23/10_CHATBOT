Hopes rise for Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal,https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire-deal-talks-01-14-25-intl/index.html,"• Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages during the first phase of an emerging ceasefire agreement being finalized by negotiators in Doha, two Israeli officials said, the first positive sign in months that a truce in the Israel-Hamas war may be in sight. • A final round of talks to finalize any issues is expected to take place in Doha today, a diplomat close to the talks told CNN. Also today, some of the hostages’ families have been invited to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. • The release of the hostages would be the first phase of the deal being finalized. Negotiations to reach the second phase – which is intended to end the war – would begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal. Here’s what we know about the potential deal. On October 7, 2023, 251 people were kidnapped when Hamas attacked Israel. Israel said that 94 hostages were still in Gaza and another 157 had been returned after a deal was reached with Hamas. Of those still held since October 7, 81 are men and 13 women. There are two children under the age of five. And 84 hostages are from Israel, eight from Thailand, one from Nepal, and another from Tanzania. Israel believes that most of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of a potential deal are alive, a senior Israeli official said, but the bodies of dead captives will also likely be among those released. If a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is agreed upon, it will go first for approval by the Israeli Security Cabinet and then to the Full Cabinet. Only a simple majority is needed, so there can be abstentions. Once the names of Palestinian prisoners are released, the Supreme Court will accept petitions for 48 hours. Protesters formed a human chain outside the Israeli parliament, also known as the Knesset, on Tuesday to demand the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, as new signs emerge that Israel and Hamas could be moving closer to a ceasefire deal. Many of those gathered held large banners with the names and faces of the captives alongside the words “DON’T leave me behind!” And “everyone is a humanitarian case! No one should be left behind!” The protest comes the same day that negotiators are due to meet in the Qatari capital Doha in the hopes of finalizing a ceasefire deal that would see the release of some of the hostages. Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages during the first phase of the emerging deal. Negotiations to reach the second phase – which is intended to end the war – would begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal. One demonstrator, Shay Dickmann, said a family member held in Gaza had been released in a previous ceasefire and hostage deal in November 2023, while another - her cousin - had been killed while in Hamas captivity in the enclave. “From my family, I know how it is when someone comes back alive on a deal,” she said. “We are not going to let go for any one of them. We want them all back home. And it sounds like there is a chance right now, but we can’t let it go until we see them stepping here in Israel,” she added. Asked if she had a message for the negotiators working on an agreement, Dickmann implored them to keep working until all the hostages were released. “We trust you to make it happen this time. We need your help. And right now it sounds like you’re the key,” she said. Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages during the first phase of an emerging ceasefire agreement being finalized by negotiators in Doha, two Israeli officials said, the first positive sign in months that a truce in the Israel-Hamas war may be in sight. Officials have expressed cautious optimism that a deal could soon be announced to halt 15 months of fighting that has destabilized the Middle East and devastated Gaza, allow for more aid into the besieged Palestinian enclave, and ensure the return of dozens of hostages held by Hamas since its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Hamas and its allies still hold 94 of the 251 hostages taken from Israel, including at least 34 of whom are dead, according to the Israeli government. Israel believes that most of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the deal are alive, a senior Israeli official told reporters on Monday, but the bodies of dead captives will also likely be among those released. The first phase would take place over an initial 42-day ceasefire. The senior Israeli official said the parties appear to be on the verge of an agreement and that Israel is prepared to immediately implement the deal once it has been inked. US President Joe Biden expressed similar optimism in a speech Monday focused on foreign policy, saying the United States was “pressing hard to close this.” President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that his understanding is “there’s been a handshake and they’re getting it finished” when asked about a potential hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier on Monday that the administration was inching closer to a potential hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza and that he believed it could be done this week. Trump’s incoming special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff told reporters last week he was working alongside Biden administration officials during peace talks between Israel and Hamas and hoped to get a temporary 42-day ceasefire deal enacted before Trump’s inauguration. Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has met with two representatives from the United States to review the “the latest developments in the ceasefire negotiations” for Gaza, the Emir’s office said Monday. Al Thani met President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, as well as President Joe Biden’s Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk. The pair have been working together in recent days with mediators to try to resolve some of the last sticking points to a ceasefire deal, sources told CNN. Qatar’s Emir talked with Biden on Monday about joint mediation efforts to end the Israel-Hamas war, the Emir’s administrative office said. He also received a Hamas delegation to review the latest developments, his office said. During the meeting with Hamas, Al Thani “reiterated the state of Qatar’s firm position on the justice of the Palestinian cause, the legitimate rights of the brotherly Palestinian people, and the establishment of their independent state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital,” his office said. A final round of talks in Doha has been scheduled for Tuesday to finalize any remaining issues related to the Gaza ceasefire deal, a diplomat close to the talks told CNN. US President Joe Biden’s Middle East envoy, Brett McGurk, and President-elect Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, have been in Doha. The head of Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad, and the head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency were also present. A source familiar with the Gaza ceasefire-hostage talks that appear close to a breakthrough told CNN that US President-elect Donald Trump is the incentive for Israel to strike a deal with Hamas. “Trump. Only Trump is the incentive. Only Trump,” the source said, adding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “wants to remain close to Trump.” Even if there is no deal by January 20, when Trump will be sworn in as president, then “we have to get to a framework” by that date, the source said."

They have been through hell,” Biden said. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump told Newsmax that his understanding is that “there’s been a handshake and they’re getting it finished.” Trump’s incoming special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff previously told reporters he was working alongside Biden administration officials during the negotiations, and hoped to get a temporary ceasefire deal enacted before Trump’s inauguration on Monday. A diplomat close to the negotiations told CNN a final round of proximity talks to finalize any issues was scheduled to take place in Doha on Tuesday. The same day, some of the hostages’ families have been invited to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. On Tuesday, protesters formed a human chain outside the Israeli parliament, also known as the Knesset, to demand the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza. Many held large banners with the names and faces of the captives alongside the words “DON’T leave me behind!” One demonstrator, Shay Dickmann, said a family member held in Gaza had been released in a previous ceasefire and hostage deal in November 2023, while another — her cousin — had been killed while in Hamas captivity in the enclave. “From my family, I know how it is when someone comes back alive on a deal,” she said. “We are not going to let go for any one of them. We want them all back home. And it sounds like there is a chance right now, but we can’t let it go until we see them stepping here in Israel.” Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees, told CNN on Monday that he was traveling to Doha to advise negotiators on the list of detainees to be released “in the event the deal materializes.” The release of the 33 hostages would be the first phase of the deal being finalized. Negotiations to reach the second phase – which is intended to end the war – would begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal. Under the latest proposals, Israeli forces would maintain a presence along the Philadelphi Corridor – a narrow strip of land along the Egypt-Gaza border – during the first phase of the agreement, the officials said. The presence of Israeli troops along the corridor previously contributed to sinking a potential deal in September during the last round of negotiations. Israel would also maintain a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border with Israel, the official said, without specifying how wide that zone would be – another subject of contention during the negotiations. A Hamas official told CNN earlier that the group wanted the buffer zone to return to the pre-October 7 size of 300-500 meters (330-545 yards) from the border line, while Israel was requesting 2,000 meters. The residents of northern Gaza would be allowed to return freely to the north of the strip, but an Israeli official claimed there would be unspecified “security arrangements” in place. Palestinian prisoners deemed responsible for killing Israelis would not be released into the West Bank, the official said, but rather to the Gaza Strip or abroad following agreements with foreign countries. CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment. A senior Israeli official told reporters on Monday that a “breakthrough” in the talks came late Sunday night during Israeli intelligence agency Mossad Director David Barnea’s meeting with the mediators in Doha, Qatar. “There is talk of an agreement in the near future – it is impossible to say whether it is a matter of hours or days,” the official said. The official said Israel is prepared to quickly implement the agreement, but the deal must first pass both the security cabinet and full government cabinet. The government must also allow time for opponents of the agreement to petition the Supreme Court. “We are closer than ever to a deal but mediators in Doha are still awaiting official responses from both sides,” said an Arab official briefed on the talks. Speaking to CNN Monday, the former Israeli intelligence official Avi Melamed cautioned that even if a deal were reached, the continued presence of the Israeli military and Hamas in Gaza during the first phase of its implementation could risk reigniting hostilities. “That part is very sensitive because it could potentially have the seeds that result in – at some point for whatever the reason – reignition or flares of fighting in Gaza. It’s not to say necessarily that that will happen, but it’s something that could happen and we should take it into consideration,” he said. Melamed said that during the first phase of a deal, neither side would want to give up leverage but in the next phase would try to exhaust “any kind of leverage cards they have” including in the context of military capacities in Gaza. Meanwhile, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Monday it remained hopeful but cautious amid the reports of a deal being close. “We continue to trust in those working tirelessly to bring our loved ones home, and we will not rest until the last hostage returns,” the group said. Israel launched its war on Hamas in Gaza following the attacks of October 7, 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. Since then, the Israeli military has killed at least 46,565 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. More than 100,000 have been injured.

"Ukraine strikes Russia in ‘major’ drone and missile attack, Russian media and officials report",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-missile-attack-intl-hnk/index.html,"Ukraine struck Russian regions with a major drone and missile attack overnight, damaging at least two factories and forcing schools to close in a major southern Russian city, according to Russian officials and media. The Shot Telegram channel said that Russia had downed more than 200 Ukrainian drones and five US-made ATACMS ballistic missiles. “The enemy has organized a massive combined strike on the territory of the Russian regions,” the Two Majors war blogger said. Alexander Bogomaz, the governor of the Bryansk region in western Russia, said Ukraine had launched a major missile attack but did not say which missiles had been used. The Russian defense ministry, which reports on such attacks, made no immediate comment. Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the reports. In the Russian city of Engels, home to an air base where Russia’s nuclear bombers are based, Saratov Governor Roman Busargin said an industrial enterprise had been damaged by a drone but gave no more details. Busargin said that classes in schools in Saratov and Engels would be held remotely. Flight restrictions were imposed in Kazan, Saratov, Penza, Ulyanovsk and Nizhnekamsk, Russia’s aviation watchdog said. Nizhnekamsk, in Russia’s republic of Tatarstan, is home to the major Taneco refinery. Shot said attack sirens were sounded at the refinery. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the report. Russia fired a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile known as “Oreshnik,” or Hazel Tree, at Ukraine on November 21 in what President Vladimir Putin said was a direct response to strikes on Russia by Ukrainian forces with US and British missiles. Putin, after those attacks, said that the Ukraine war was escalating towards a global conflict after the United States and Britain allowed Ukraine to hit Russia with their weapons, and warned the West that Moscow could strike back. President-elect Donald Trump has pushed for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the war quickly, leaving Washington’s long-term support for Ukraine in question. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis."
Dramatic showdown looms in South Korea as Yoon faces impeachment trial and possible arrest,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/asia/south-korea-yoon-impeachment-trial-intl-hnk/index.html,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s fate remains in the balance after the suspended leader failed to appear at the first day of his impeachment trial Tuesday following weeks of evading arrest, delaying what is set to be a dramatic political showdown. Yoon has been holed up in his fortified residence, surrounded by his Presidential Security Service (PSS) team, after his short-lived declaration of martial law in December triggered widespread public outrage and protests, plunging the country into its biggest political crisis in decades. The former prosecutor-turned-politician was stripped of his presidential powers last month after parliament voted to impeach him over the decree. The country’s Constitutional Court now has the ultimate say over whether he will be formally removed or reinstated. Tuesday’s court session ended after just four minutes when the president refused to show. However, a hearing planned for Thursday will proceed with or without Yoon in attendance. The parliamentary impeachment panel is seeking “a swift decision to remove the president to restore broken democracy, constitutional order, and to quickly resolve the uncertainties in the economy,” said Lee Kwang-beom, one of the panel’s lawyers. Yoon had previously indicated through his lawyer that he would not attend Tuesday’s hearing due to safety concerns relating to efforts to detain him for questioning, according to South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency. Yoon is wanted for questioning in multiple investigations, including allegations he led an insurrection – a crime punishable by life imprisonment or even the death penalty. Yoon maintains he acted legitimately in declaring martial law and considers the warrant “illegal and invalid.” He has told his supporters he will “fight until the end.” For weeks, the suspended leader has barricaded himself in his heavily-fortified hillside compound in the capital Seoul, while outside the gates hundreds of his die-hard conservative supporters have vowed to protect him. Supporters are concerned Yoon will be detained if he leaves his residence to attend the impeachment hearings. Rival protesters have also braved cold conditions to call for his arrest. Corruption investigators are determined to execute the arrest warrant against Yoon – the first time such action has been taken against a sitting president. Tensions exploded earlier this month when investigators attempted to detain Yoon at his residence, resulting in a dramatic hours-long standoff between dozens of police and a “human wall” of around 200 soldiers and members of the presidential security detail. The arrest attempt was later called off with investigators citing the safety of the people on the ground, though the arrest warrant was extended. In an apparent effort to thwart a second expected attempt to detain Yoon, barbed wire has been erected on walls around the compound and entrances have been blocked by vehicles, according to video shared last week by CNN affiliate JTBC. Yoon has also filed legal complaints against those who tried to arrest him including the head of the state anti-corruption agency. Yoon swiftly rescinded his late-night martial law declaration on December 3, after lawmakers pushed past security forces blocking their way into parliament and voted down the decree. The National Assembly then voted to impeach Yoon after several members of his own ruling party turned on him. Parliament also voted to impeach the country’s prime minister and acting president Han Duck-soo. The finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, is now acting president. The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to decide whether to uphold or reject the impeachment vote, and has vowed to make the case a “top priority.” Complicating the deliberations is that the nine-member court currently only has eight justices, due to a delay in filling vacancies left by retired justices. Acting President Choi recently filled two out of three vacancies on the court appointed by the parliament, and the remaining position will be reviewed by the court later this month. Under South Korea’s constitution, at least six justices must approve an impeachment for it to be upheld. If the Constitutional Court upholds Yoon’s impeachment, he would become the shortest-serving president in South Korea’s democratic history. The country must then hold new presidential elections within 60 days. While Yoon has been suspended from exercising his powers, he has not been officially removed from office. That means he still has presidential immunity from most criminal charges – except for insurrection or treason. South Korea’s police, military, and anti-corruption body have formed a joint investigation team to examine the charges of insurrection and abuse of power against Yoon. Meanwhile, prosecutors are investigating key figures involved in the martial law operation, including commanders and the defense minister. Yoon has refused to answer three summonses in recent weeks asking for his cooperation, according to the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO.) Much of the spotlight has fallen on the presidential security team, the PSS, which has been accused of acting like Yoon’s personal bodyguards. Previously, the CIO said “it is virtually impossible to execute a warrant” at Yoon’s residence while security there remains in place. However, corruption investigators appear to be pushing ahead with their second attempt to arrest the suspended president. The CIO on Sunday asked the country’s defense ministry to ensure soldiers dispatched to the security team protecting Yoon do not disrupt efforts to arrest him. It also said the security team should avoid an “illegal act” such as mobilizing security personnel for jobs outside of their duties, and warned that disruption could result in criminal punishment. There is also some confusion as to which agency has jurisdiction to carry out the arrest warrant. Yoon’s lawyers on Monday accused the police of being complicit in an “illegal arrest and abuse of power,” and that “any evidence obtained through such actions would be deemed illegal.” Yoon’s lawyers argue the warrant should be executed by the CIO, not the police. South Korean law, however, states that police are authorized to assist other authorities in carrying out public duties. On Friday, the head of Yoon’s PSS, Park Chong-jun, resigned before undergoing police questioning over his role in blocking Yoon’s arrest, according to the security team. Once the warrant has been enforced, it starts a 48-hour countdown for investigators to hold and question Yoon. The CIO would need to apply for another warrant within that period to formally arrest him. This story has been updated with additional information."
This 300-year-old farming village was abandoned in the 1960s. Now residents are moving back,https://edition.cnn.com/world/asia/hong-kong-hakka-village-sustainability-hnk-spc/index.html,"Surrounded by forest-covered mountains cloaked in mist, a patchwork quilt of green farmland and steel-blue waves breaking on mangrove-strewn mudflats, Lai Chi Wo does not look like it belongs in Hong Kong. The remote 300-year-old village is one of the city’s oldest settlements — and one of its most biodiverse. Its location is no accident: it draws on the traditional philosophies of the Hakka people, one of Hong Kong’s pre-colonial indigenous groups, who built the settlement. “We maintain what is called a feng-shui forest, to preserve the village,” says Susan Wong. The 73-year-old grandmother is the village chief, and was born in Lai Chi Wo, when the town was home to around 1,000 residents. “From our ancestors to now, it has been passed down, not to let anyone cut down the trees. If you cut all the trees out, the mountain will become bare, and nothing can cover the village.” Feng shui — which literally means “wind” and “water” — is a design philosophy about how homes, villages and cities should be arranged for good fortune. In Lai Chi Wo, the position of the forest is intended to shelter the village from typhoons, prevent landslides, and manage extreme heat and cold. However, in the 1960s, residents began to leave their ancestral home: Hong Kong was industrializing rapidly, and it was becoming hard to make a living from farming. “We didn’t even have shoes or clothes to wear,” Wong recalls. Lai Chi Wo is so remote that, even today, it can only be reached by a three-hour hike through the jungle, or a long boat trip around the coast. In the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s, many families emigrated overseas — like Wong’s, who moved to the UK when she was 15 — for better opportunities, and elderly residents passed away. Lai Chi Wo became a ghost town. Over the decades that Lai Chi Wo lay empty, buildings crumbled, and farmland grew wild with weeds. The roots of banyan trees twined around open doorways, and wild boar or lost hikers were the only foot traffic through the decaying village. But Lai Chi Wo was not entirely forgotten. “Elsewhere in Hong Kong, many abandoned villages had houses collapsed beyond recognition and vegetation invaded the whole village,” says Chiu Ying Lam, head of the Hong Kong Countryside Foundation. However, when he first visited Lai Chi Wo in 2009, he was surprised to find several homes were well maintained. Lam speculated that these absentee homeowners were still connected to their ancestral home, and were planning to return one day, perhaps to retire. This sparked an idea that would eventually become the Sustainable Lai Chi Wo program: a decade-long collaboration between NGOs, universities and government agencies to restore the village to its former glory. In re-establishing the community, the unique biodiversity around the village could be protected too, says Lam. Over the years, Lam estimates around HK$100 million ($12.8 million) in funding from businesses, non-profits and the Hong Kong government has been invested into the village’s redevelopment, including the restoration of five hectares of farmland and the reconstruction of 15 dilapidated homes. While the project aimed to bring back former residents, it also wanted to bring in new people. In 2015, Ah Him Tsang and his wife, who are not Hakka, were one of the first families to move to the village, looking for a life “closer to nature” to raise their then-infant son. Like many residents in Lai Chi Wo, Tsang works a variety of jobs: he grows vegetables and cash crops on a small farm, and on weekends, runs “Hakka Experience” homestays and a store that serves locally grown tea, coffee, and homemade vegan ice cream to tourists who pass through. “I also grow these vegetables for my staycation program, (for a) farm-to-table dining experience,” says Tsang, adding that the Hakka Experience is designed to give visitors a more authentic experience of village life. “You can really feel the quietness, the serenity of the nature here. I hope more people can stay longer and enjoy the slow pace.” The influx of new residents to Lai Chi Wo encouraged more of the original residents to move back, too. Upon retiring, Wong returned to Hong Kong from the UK to care for her elderly parents, and heard about the revitalization project. In 2019, she decided to return to the village with her now-103-year-old father, into the home they were both born in. “I’m very happy because I like this village. I have so many friends (who have) come back,” she says. With her father, Wong runs a small farm, growing mandarin oranges, lemons, chilis, flowers, and vegetables, and uses organic agriculture techniques, such as grinding up discarded oyster shells to make plant food. The project also introduced new crops like coffee, which grows in the shade. This agroforestry technique protects the forest by growing high-value plants around the perimeter of the native woodland, while boosting profits for farmers. Lai Chi Wo now has around 700 coffee plants across several farms, making it the “biggest coffee-producing region in Hong Kong,” says Ryan Siu Him Leung, senior project officer at the Centre for Civil Society and Governance at the University of Hong Kong, which oversaw parts of Lai Chi Wo’s revitalization program. The University of Hong Kong is leasing some of the land for experimental farming, and helping villagers turn their crops into higher-value products in a licensed food processing plant in nearby Sha Tau Kok, on Hong Kong’s border with mainland China. Products include pickles and unusual fruit jams, or seasonal foods like popular radish cake for Chinese New Year, says Leung. “We’re also looking at traditional Hakka recipes, and trying to explore the possibility of turning those recipes into commercial products,” he says, adding that they are currently selling via local supermarket suppliers and pop-up farmers markets, and plan to launch an online shop soon, to reach more customers. While the project has garnered positive attention — including recognition from UNESCO in 2020 for cultural heritage conservation and sustainable development — it’s not all been smooth sailing. There’s been resistance from some of the original villagers, who claim they were not properly consulted about the redevelopment. Additionally, more than a decade into the project, the village is still not financially sustainable, and is supported by external funding, including government subsidies for the farmers. Farming at such a small scale is largely unprofitable; so like Tsang, most residents have multiple income streams. Leung says that most of the new residents work remote jobs online, or in creative industries, with farming as a hobby where any income is a bonus. Leung says that, aside from preserving the town’s traditional lifestyle, there’s an ecological advantage to maintaining the farmland: sustainable agriculture helps to better manage water drainage and improve soil health. Even if the village isn’t economically independent, he feels it’s worthwhile, and that cultivating a sustainable community is more important. “As long as there are people willing to stay in the village, and they are making their living — to me, it’s financially viable for those individual households.” The project has become a model for sustainable revitalization, and the Forest Village Project, launched in 2024, is applying the lessons from Lai Chi Wo to two nearby hamlets, Mui Tsz Lam and Kop Tong. These settlements are around one-tenth the size of Lai Chi Wo, says Leung, but they both have a feng shui woodland, diverse flora and fauna, and offer the potential to develop a wider eco-tourism destination. “Hopefully, we could have a more comprehensive region of revitalized villages, which (could be) a bigger attraction to the wider (Hong Kong) community,” Leung adds."
Brazil restricts use of smartphones in elementary and high schools,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/americas/brazil-restricts-smartphones-in-schools-intl-latam/index.html,"Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Monday signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations. The move will impact students at elementary and high schools across the South American nation starting in February. It provides a legal framework to ensure students only use such devices in cases of emergency and danger, for educational purposes, or if they have disabilities and require them. Education minister Camilo Santana told journalists in the capital Brasilia on Monday that children are going online at early ages, making it harder for parents to keep track of what they do, and that restricting smartphones at school will help them. “We want those devices, as in many other countries, to only be used in class for pedagogical purposes and with a teacher’s guidance,” Santana said. The bill had rare support across the political spectrum, both from allies of leftist Lula and his far-right foe, former President Jair Bolsonaro. Many parents and students also approved the move. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents supported banning the use of smartphones by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children. “(Restricting cell phones) is tough, but necessary. It is useful for them to do searches for school, but to use it socially isn’t good,” said Ricardo Martins Ramos, 43, father of two girls and the owner of a hamburger restaurant in Rio de Janeiro. “Kids will interact more.” His 13-year-old daughter Isabela said her classmates struggled to focus during class because of their smartphones. She approved the move, but doesn’t see it as enough to improve the learning environment for everyone. “When the teacher lets you use the cell phone, it is because he wants you to do searches,” she said. “There’s still a lot of things that schools can’t solve, such as bullying and harassment.” As of 2023, about two-thirds of Brazilian schools imposed some restriction on cellphone use, while 28% banned them entirely, according to a survey released in August by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee. The Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias have already passed local bills to ban such devices at schools. However, authorities have struggled to enforce these laws. Authorities in Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil, are discussing whether smartphones should be banned both in public and private schools. Gabriele Alexandra Henriques Pinheiro, 25, works at a beauty parlor and is the mother of a boy diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She also agrees with the restrictions, but says adults will continue to be as a bad example of smartphone use for children. “It is tough,” she said. “I try to restrict the time my son watches any screens, but whenever I have a task to perform I have to use the smartphone to be able to do it all,” she said. Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children’s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15. Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms. An increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health. A report published in September by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, said one in four countries has already restricted the use of such devices at schools. Last year in a US Senate hearing, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media. He also noted Meta’s continued investments in “industrywide” efforts to protect children."
Baby gorilla rescued from cargo hold of Turkish Airlines plane,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/world/baby-gorilla-turkish-airlines-intl-scli/index.html,"A young gorilla rescued from a plane’s cargo hold is recovering at an Istanbul zoo, officials said Sunday, while wildlife officers consider returning him to his natural habitat. The 5-month-old gorilla was discovered in a box on a Turkish Airlines flight from Nigeria to Thailand last month. After a public competition, he has been named Zeytin, or Olive, and is recuperating at Polonezkoy Zoo. “Of course, what we want and desire is for the baby gorilla … to continue its life in its homeland,” Fahrettin Ulu, regional director of Istanbul Nature Conservation and National Parks, said Sunday. “What is important is that an absolutely safe environment is established in the place it goes to, which is extremely important for us.” In the weeks since he was found, Zeytin has gained weight and is showing signs of recovering from his traumatic journey. “When he first came, he was very shy, he would stay where we left him,” said veterinarian Gulfem Esmen. “He doesn’t have that shyness now. He doesn’t even care about us much. He plays games by himself.” Both gorilla species — the western and eastern gorillas, which populate central Africa’s remote forests and mountains — are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. As Istanbul emerges as a major air hub between continents, customs officials have increasingly intercepted illegally traded animals. In October, 17 young Nile crocodiles and 10 monitor lizards were found in an Egyptian passenger’s luggage at the city’s Sabiha Gokcen Airport."
Taiwan sees threefold surge in suspected Chinese espionage cases,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/china/taiwan-surge-suspected-chinese-espionage-hnk-intl/index.html,"Taiwan has seen a “significant rise” in the number of individuals charged with spying for China in recent years, according to new data released by the island’s security bureau, amid escalating intimidation by Beijing. In a report released Sunday, Taiwan’s National Security Bureau (NSB) said the number of individuals prosecuted for Chinese espionage had increased threefold in recent years, rising from 16 in 2021 to 64 in 2024. Of those 64 charged, 15 were military veterans and 28 were active service members, according to the report, which said targets of Chinese infiltration included military units, government agencies and local associations. The number of prosecutions last year was the highest seen in a decade, a senior security official told CNN, and comes as Taiwan has faced increasing intimidation from Beijing. Beijing claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has vowed to take control of it, by force if necessary, despite having never controlled it. The Taiwanese government has repeatedly rejected China’s sovereignty claims and emphasized that Taiwan’s future can only be decided by its 23.5 million people. “The Chinese Communist Party continues to use diverse channels and means to infiltrate all walks of life in order to absorb citizens to help them develop networks or gather sensitive government information,” the report said. In recent years, Beijing has stepped up its pressure on the island, launching large-scale military drills more frequently and raising alarm over the possible deployment of “gray zone” tactics – acts that fall below the threshold of war. Taiwan officials’ suspicions earlier this month that a Chinese vessel may have been responsible for damage to an undersea internet cable underscored concerns on the island about vulnerabilities that could be exploited by Beijing in so-called “gray zone operations.” In December, China also fielded its largest regional maritime deployment in decades – including multiple formations of Chinese naval and coast guard vessels – in regional waters and around the Taiwan Strait, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. For years, Taiwan’s security agencies have warned about Beijing’s growing attempts to infiltrate its armed forces and their espionage activities, particularly efforts to bribe military officers in exchange for national secrets. The latest report said that improved counter-intelligence capabilities has allowed authorities in Taiwan to uncover more cases of suspected Chinese espionage. It said Chinese agents allegedly attempted to establish contacts with criminal gangs and local temples, as well as setting up underground banks to recruit military personnel and China-friendly groups in Taiwan. The report added, without specifying details of the cases, that some of the suspected spies were tasked to serve as agents of “sabotage” and raise China’s flag in the event of a Chinese invasion. Some were also asked to gather intelligence in a move to build a “sniper team” for an “assassination assignment.” CNN has reached out to China’s Taiwan Affairs Office for comment. China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS), which oversees intelligence and counterintelligence both within China and overseas, has also previously accused Taiwan of conducting spying activities. Last August, the ministry said it had uncovered over a thousand Taiwanese espionage cases in recent years and dismantled a number of espionage networks. China’s MSS has also launched a high-profile campaign against what it says is a surge in espionage activities by foreign nationals at a time when relations with western powers, especially the United States, have cratered. Chao Yu-hsiang, a resident search officer at Taiwan’s Institute of National Defense and Security Research (INDSR), said he hopes the recent surge in prosecutions by Taiwan would prompt the Taiwanese military to enhance security measures. “Both our military and civilians should maintain a high level of vigilance in our words and deeds, develop good confidentiality habits, and use social media with caution to prevent those with ulterior motives from infiltrating, absorbing and exploiting us,” he wrote in a column published by INDSR on Monday."
Ukraine’s ‘Bachelor’ starred an amputee. He’s one of many injured veterans navigating a new sex life,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/europe/sexual-rehabilitation-demand-ukraine-intl/index.html,"When 35-year-old combat medic Tetyana Tsymbaliuk regained consciousness in the hospital room, she found her boyfriend waiting with a bunch of flowers. He proposed, but she declined. After a serious injury, her leg had been amputated; she worried about being a burden as a wife. “I realized that before amputation, I was more attractive. I was not sure that I could find a way to fulfil my family role as a woman,” said Tsymbaliuk. It took her a long time to regain her confidence. Tsymbaliuk says she was one of the first Ukrainian military amputees following the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. Almost three years on, nearly 370,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been wounded. Thousands have lost one or more limbs. While the government does not provide official figures on amputations, a state program issued prostheses to almost 20,000 people across 2023 and the first half of 2024, and many others were helped by private programs in Ukraine and abroad. In the past two years, Ukraine has implemented protocols for physical and, to some degree, psychological rehabilitation for those injured in conflict. But sexual rehabilitation for people who have lost limbs or suffered other serious injuries has been largely overlooked. Sex has long been a taboo topic in Ukraine.  While modern Ukrainians are more open about sex than in the Soviet era, the topic is still an uncomfortable one for many. “In our culture, we don’t really have a habit of talking about sex. Not all people can even say this word calmly. It is generally not acceptable to tell a stranger or even a partner about your sex issues,” military psychologist and sexologist Hanna Revunets told CNN, adding that men or women who have lost limbs because of the war rarely ask for help regarding such a sensitive subject. “If I ask veterans about sex issues, they usually say that everything is okay. Only a few of them after a while, when they start to trust me, can talk about the problems they have,” Revunets said. There are no protocols or recommendations for sexual rehabilitation on the official governmental level, she said, or even any mention of it. “That’s important because the doctor is required to work according to protocol,” Revunets said. “Sexual rehabilitation is not specified anywhere, so the doctor can only take the initiative if he or she wants to do so. But most doctors aren’t ready to talk about it.” It takes time even to persuade some doctors of its significance, Revunets said. “When I tell my colleagues about the importance of sexual rehabilitation, they look at me as if I’m crazy, (someone) who doesn’t understand what kind of serious injuries the patient has,” she said. A good sexologist can help in many ways. Revunets is one of the very few sexologists in the country who works with the military. “I find out what exactly is wrong with the patient. I ask how the person feels. Depending on this, I give advice - it can be advice on how and what to do from a technical point of view, or what medications to take, or help psychologically.” The war has resulted in an unprecedented number of people with injuries, a situation for which Ukraine was unprepared. The lack of any information on sexual rehabilitation has motivated the Ukrainian nonprofit Veteran Hub, which is specifically dedicated to supporting war veterans and their families, to study the topic. In 2023, Veteran Hub researchers conducted 39 in-depth interviews with injured soldiers and their partners. Among other things, interviewees spoke anonymously about their sex lives after injury. Researchers found that sex itself had changed for many. For example, after being injured, some respondents started to prepare for or plan sexual relations due to physical changes. One of the veterans in a long-term relationship said of the doctors who treated him: “I was told to have sex, but no one told me how. If we’re talking about the technical part, it is very important.” He told researchers that without formal resources available to them, men were having to pass on information “by word of mouth.” In response to the researchers’ findings, Veteran Hub created a guide for veterans on how to restore their sexual lives after being wounded. “We saw that there was a great demand for this topic. After physical rehabilitation, people start asking themselves whether they will be able to swim in the sea, go skiing, go on dates, or have sex. And usually no one can answer these questions,” said Veteran Hub project manager Kateryna Skorohod. Olga Serdyuk, chief executive of the Olena Pinchuk Foundation, which runs a sexual educational program at a network of rehabilitation centers called Recovery, said: “We need to understand that a wounded person works with different specialists – surgeons, physiotherapists, psychologists – on the way to rehabilitation. Because there is a lack of sexologists in Ukraine, those doctors must be ready for the person to open up to them and talk about sexual rehabilitation.” To help  widen their knowledge, Recovery launched a course called “Sexual Life” to train doctors and other professionals working with Ukrainian soldiers. Serious injury changes the life of not only the veteran but also their partner, Serdyuk explained. “For some reason, Ukrainian society believes that a good wife should take care of her husband on her own, even if there is an opportunity to get help. A woman becomes a carer. What kind of sex can we talk about then?” Serdyuk said, referring to how the pressures of full-time caring can lessen a couple’s capacity to explore paths to sexual fulfilment. “Even if we are talking about complete dysfunction or missing genitals, a person (who’s been injured) can still have an orgasm with pleasure. You have to work with your fantasies, study your body.” People need to learn to accept themselves in a new way, and believe in their integrity, their body, Serdyuk said. Discussions surrounding disabilities are increasingly cropping up in Ukraine as casualties rise. Popular dating show “The Bachelor” has taken the discussion into the mainstream, with 26-year-old Ukrainian veteran Oleksandr Budko – who lost both his legs in the war - cast as the star of the latest season. An episode with an intimate scene, shown in November, became one of the most popular in the season. According to data provided by Starlight Media, a Ukrainian broadcasting group, about 2.8 million people all around the country watched it, making it the most viewed program on the day it aired. “This is the first time in the history of the show among all countries of the world that a man with a double amputation has become a Bachelor,” show producer Anna Kalyna told CNN. “We were concerned about how people would react to seeing a person’s body with visible amputations in such an intimate context. There is no representation of people living with injuries in Ukraine and we didn’t know how people would react to it. It was a big challenge. But it turned out well.” Kalyna thinks the audience was interested, in part, because they realize that in this time of war their own loved ones could be injured at any moment. On his Instagram page, Budko said he was not taking part in the show to convince anyone of anything or prove his “normality.” “My prostheses or even sometimes a wheelchair are just a part of me, but not what defines me,” he posted. “The fact that I have a disability does not make me less worthy of love or a happy life. And this is important to understand.” Budko also posted that his first experience of sex after injury “was not just sex, but a step back to life.” Among those to attend Recovery’s “Sexual Life” course is Oleksandr Batalov. The unit infantry commander, who works as an osteopath in civil life, lost his leg in a fierce battle on the front line. He recalls that it took time for him to get used to his changed body. “At the beginning, with such trauma, you want no one to look at you. But my wife gave me huge support. So, I got a grip. I chose life, not suffering,” he said. The psychologist helped a lot, he added. There are very few sexologists in the hospitals, he said, but men who have experienced serious injuries are talking about sex with one another, and that’s important. However, “they need to have specialists they can talk to” as well, Batalov said. That’s why he is starting this course. “If you survived, you have to live. Despite the injury, my life is full and interesting, I want to leave and study and share the knowledge,” said Batalov, who is now working again as an osteopath. The same goes for Tsymbaliuk, the injured combat medic. She decided to live a fulfilling life no matter what. Her boyfriend did not give up and proposed again. After months of rehabilitation in Germany, and later in Ukraine’s Superhumans Center, she finally married him, realizing “she was full of love that she wanted to fulfil.” Four months ago, they welcomed their first child together. “I’m not hiding my prosthetic. I’m living a full life. And I’m happy,” she said. CNN’s Victoria Butenko contributed reporting."
Russia forms emergency task force as Kerch Strait oil spill spreads,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/europe/russia-emergency-task-force-kerch-strait-oil-spill-intl-hnk/index.html,"(AP) — An emergency task force arrived in Russia’s southern Krasnodar region on Sunday as an oil spill in the Kerch Strait from two storm-stricken tankers continues to spread a month after it was first detected, officials said. The task force, which includes Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Kurenkov, was set up after Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on authorities to ramp up the response to the spill, calling it “one of the most serious environmental challenges we have faced in recent years.” Kurenkov said that “the most difficult situation” had developed near the port of Taman in the Krasnodar region, where fuel oil continues to leak into the sea from the damaged part of the Volgoneft-239 tanker. Kurenkov was quoted as saying by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that the remaining oil will be pumped out of the tanker’s stern. The Emergencies Ministry said Saturday that over 155,000 tons of contaminated sand and soil had been collected since oil spilled out of two tankers during a storm four weeks ago in the Kerch Strait, which separates the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula from the Krasnodar region. Russian-installed officials in Ukraine’s partially Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region said Saturday that the mazut — a heavy, low-quality oil product — had reached the Berdyansk Spit, some 145 kilometers (90 miles) north of the Kerch Strait. It contaminated an area 14.5 kilometers (9 miles) long, Moscow-installed Gov. Yevgeny Balitsky wrote on Telegram. Russian-appointed officials in Moscow-occupied Crimea announced a regional emergency last weekend after oil was detected on the shores of Sevastopol, the peninsula’s largest city, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from the Kerch Strait. In response to Putin’s call for action, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi accused Russia of “beginning to demonstrate its alleged ‘concern’ only after the scale of the disaster became too obvious to conceal its terrible consequences.” “Russia’s practice of first ignoring the problem, then admitting its inability to solve it, and ultimately leaving the entire Black Sea region alone with the consequences is yet another proof of its international irresponsibility,” Tykhyi said Friday. The Kerch Strait is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office, described the oil spill last month as a “large-scale environmental disaster” and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers."
Malala Yousafzai urges Muslim leaders to back gender apartheid legal push,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/asia/malala-yousafzai-gender-apartheid-intl-hnk/index.html,"Islamabad, Pakistan (Reuters) — Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai urged Muslim leaders on Sunday to back efforts to make gender apartheid a crime under international law, and called on them to speak out against Afghanistan’s Taliban over its treatment of women and girls. At a summit on girls’ education in Muslim communities attended by international leaders and scholars in her home country of Pakistan, Yousafzai said Muslim voices must lead the way against the policies of the Taliban, who have barred teenage girls from school and women from universities. “In Afghanistan an entire generation of girls will be robbed of its future,” she said in a speech in Islamabad. “As Muslim leaders, now is the time to raise your voice, use your power.” The Taliban say they respect women’s rights in accordance with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law. Taliban administration spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Yousafzai’s statements. No foreign government has formally recognized the Taliban since it took over Afghanistan in 2021 and diplomats have said steps towards recognition require a change of course on women’s rights. Yousafzai survived being shot in the head when she was 15 in Pakistan by a gunman after campaigning against the Pakistani Taliban’s moves to deny girls an education. The summit, organised by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Muslim World League, included dozens of ministers and scholars from Muslim-majority countries. Yousafzai asked the scholars to “openly challenge and denounce the Taliban’s oppressive laws” and for political leaders to support the addition of gender apartheid to crimes against humanity under international criminal law. The summit was hosted by Pakistan, which has had frosty relations with the Afghan Taliban in recent months over accusations that militants are using Afghan soil to launch attacks on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban deny."
Italy releases Iranian businessman wanted by US over drone attack that killed Americans,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/europe/italy-iran-diplomacy-mohammad-abedini-intl/index.html,"Iranian businessman Mohammad Abedini, who was detained in Italy at the request of the United States following a drone attack that killed three Americans, has been released. Abedini, 38, was arrested in Milan in December on a warrant issued by the US and charged in connection with a drone strike that killed three US Army soldiers and injured dozens more in Jordan last year. The US Justice Department had charged Abedini and Mahdi Mohammad Sadeghi, 42, with conspiring to export the drone technology from the US to Iran. Italy’s Justice Minister Carlo Nordio on Sunday made a request to Milan’s court of appeal to cancel Abedini’s arrest, saying that Italy could not extradite Abedini to the US because “only crimes punishable under the laws of both (countries)” could lead to extradition. Abedini’s lawyer, Alfredo De Francesco, told CNN that Nordio’s decision “happily surprised us,” and that he had argued from the outset that there were no conditions for extradition. “Now my client is a free person and will be able to smile and hope again,” De Francesco said. Mizan, the news agency for Iran’s judiciary, said Abedini’s arrest was the result of a “misunderstanding,” which various Iranian ministries had resolved. Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Abedini had returned home since his release earlier Sunday. Abedini was arrested on December 16, three days before Cecilia Sala, a journalist with the Italian daily Il Foglio, was detained while on a reporting trip to Tehran and accused of “violating the laws of the Islamic republic of Iran.” Sala was freed and returned home last week, leading to speculation about whether she was used as a bargaining chip for Abedini’s release. Sala’s release came shortly after Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited US President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where she was expected to discuss Sala’s case. In its statement on Sunday, Italy’s Justice Ministry said the charge against Abedini – criminal association to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act – “does not correspond to the cases provided for and punished by the Italian criminal system.” The US Justice Department accused Abedini of involvement in a drone attack on a small US outpost in Jordan in January 2024, the first time US troops were killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the beginning of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Three US Army soldiers were killed and more than 30 service members were injured."
"An Austrian woman has been kidnapped in Niger’s Agadez city, authorities say",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/africa/austrian-kidnapped-niger-intl-latam/index.html,"An Austrian woman has been kidnapped by gunmen in Niger’s Agadez city, local residents and the Austrian foreign ministry said on Sunday, the first time a European citizen is known to have been kidnapped in the conflict-hit West African nation since a military junta took power in 2023. The ministry said Austria’s embassy in Algeria, which is also responsible for Niger, had been informed of the kidnap of an Austrian woman in Agadez and was in contact with regional authorities on the ground. Residents and local media identified the victim as Eva Gretzmacher and reported she is an aid worker who has lived in Agadez – hundreds of kilometers (miles) away from the capital city of Niamey – for more than 20 years. “(She) is well known for her social commitment (and) created a skills center in 2010 that initiated various projects, notably in the fields of education, women’s empowerment, ecology, culture and art,” the local Air Info Agadez reported. Gretzmacher also supported education programs through her development work and provided assistance to local non-government organizations in various sectors, local media said. No group claimed responsibility for her abduction and authorities in Niger did not immediately comment on the incident. Niger has for many years battled a jihadi insurgency linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, a security crisis that analysts say has worsened since the military toppled the country’s government in July 2023. Despite their promise to restore peace in hot spots, the junta’s capacity to improve Niger’s security has increasingly been questioned amid increasing attacks. Niger was seen as one of the last democratic countries in Africa’s Sahel region that Western nations could partner with to beat back the jihadi insurgency in the vast expanse below the Sahara Desert. The country has severed decades-long military ties with the West and turned to Russia as a new security partner."

"Items belonging to second British hiker missing in Italy found, rescuers say",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/europe/missing-hiker-italy-belongings-found-scli-intl/index.html,"Items belonging to missing British hiker Aziz Ziriat have been found in the Italian Alps, close to where the body of his hiking partner Samuel Harris was discovered last week, rescue teams said Sunday. More than 100 rescuers took part in Sunday’s operation, using shovels to dig into the snow across an area of around 5,500 square meters (18,000 square feet) at an altitude of around 2,400 meters (7,800 feet), according to a statement from Italy’s alpine rescue service. “Snow depth varied from 50 centimeters (20 inches) to nearly two meters (6.6 feet) in wind-drifted accumulations,” the statement said. The rescue service said more than 500 people, including seven dog units, were involved in the “complex” search operation. Search operations will now be “temporarily suspended” to allow for changes in the environmental and snow conditions, adds the statement. Ziriat, 36 and Harris, 35, were experienced hikers who had planned an excursion in the Adamello mountain range near Trento in northern Italy but went missing on January 1, reported the Associated Press. Rescue services said they only received an alert about the pair on January 6 after they failed to check in for their flight home and relatives alerted the authorities, according to the Associated Press. The search operation was complicated by snowfall, fog and avalanche warnings, but on January 8, Harris’ body, as well as the men’s backpacks and equipment, was found by rescuers guided by their phone records."
Ukraine losing ground on the battlefield as Trump team pushes ceasefire,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/europe/ukraine-russia-east-battlefield-analysis-trump-intl/index.html,"With just a week before Donald Trump re-enters the White House, Ukraine is bracing for some tough choices in the coming months. Its troops are on the back foot against Russia along several parts of the long frontline, it is short of experienced soldiers and doubtful that military aid will continue to arrive at anything like the current rate. In Kyiv, the government waits and watches the signals from Moscow and Washington and reiterates almost daily its desire for a “just peace.” Any thought of recovering the territory seized by Russia is on indefinite hold. Despite taking heavy losses, Russian forces continue to push forward remorselessly in Donetsk region, one of four that Moscow has illegally annexed and is seeking to fully occupy. Their daily gains are measured in fields and streets as they creep towards the industrial belt of the region. According to open source analysts WarMapper, Russia is occupying just over 18% of Ukraine – including Crimea and the areas of Donetsk and Luhansk that it had taken before 2022. Russian forces had taken some 150 square miles (400 square kilometers) in December. Ukrainian units are vastly outnumbered in the east. One commander said this week that small groups of Russian infantry were conducting assaults from multiple directions at once, making it difficult for Ukrainian forces to concentrate fire. “While the correlation of forces with respect to tactical fires, drones, and long-range strike appears to not be favoring either side to a significant extent, manpower remains the key differentiator between Russia and Ukraine,” says Mick Ryan, who writes the blog Futura Doctrina. Russian units are now 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the hub of Pokrovsk and have taken control of Kurakhove and part of the town of Toretsk, according to geolocated video. The commander of one Ukrainian battalion near Pokrovsk said Russian forces there had intensified shelling and glide-bomb strikes. Military spokesman Viktor Tregubov told Ukrainian television that fighting continued around Kurakhove and troops were holding out at the power plant, “so we cannot say that Russian troops have taken the town completely. But, of course, most of the town has been reduced to rubble.” The Russian “model of simple attrition is unchanged.  The enemy inevitably wears down before the Russian steamroller wears down,” as analysts Keith D. Dickson and Yurij Holowinsky put it. The goal for Kyiv is to defend what it still holds. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said at a meeting with allies – the Ukraine Defense Contact Group – in Germany last week that Ukraine’s priorities this year would be stabilizing the front line and strengthening its defense capabilities. Contact Group members have committed more than $126 billion in security assistance to Ukraine over the past three years. Partners pledged further aid in Germany this week, including 30,000 drones over the next year and more air defense systems. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday that the coalition “must continue to stand foursquare with Ukraine — and to strengthen Ukraine’s hand for the negotiations that will someday bring Putin’s monstrous war to a close.” It’s the “someday” that is the burning question. Austin said of the incoming Trump administration: “I won’t speculate on which direction they would go in.” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius even suggested the incoming US administration might discontinue the Contact Group meetings, saying that if so “it will need to continue in another form.” Negotiations on ending the conflict seem unlikely at present. “The reason is simple. Moscow is not ready for any compromises. It plays for victory, not a draw,” says Arkady Moshes, writing in 19FortyFive. “Success can be achieved on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, but it must be unquestionable. In Putin’s view, Ukraine needs to be defeated, and the West has to admit Ukraine’s – and its own – defeat publicly,” Moshes adds. Trump’s Ukraine envoy, former US general Keith Kellogg, said last week that he hoped to be able to come up with a solid and sustainable solution to the conflict within 100 days. Trump himself had said on the campaign trail that he would get the fighting stopped within 24 hours of taking office, but when asked more recently how soon he could end the conflict said: “I hope to have six months. No, I would think, I hope long before six months.” How the Kremlin’s unchanged goals square with the incoming Trump administration’s plans is unclear. Ryan, the Futura Doctrina blogger, believes Putin “is likely to ensure that no matter what, the 100-day objective fails. He has no compelling reason to come to the table right now, thinking he has the momentum in this war.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has given little indication of the parameters that would be acceptable to Ukraine. He said Friday: “We will undoubtedly stand firm and achieve a lasting peace for our people and our country.” His priority is to make Ukraine’s case to Trump directly. Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi on the same day said Ukraine was preparing for talks at “the highest levels.” “Our stance is clear: everyone in Ukraine wants to end the war on terms that are fair to Ukraine.” At the heart of any settlement for Kyiv would be short-term guarantees that a ceasefire could be monitored and longer-term guarantees for Ukraine that would deter Putin from using a ceasefire to re-group and renew hostilities. That must include “significant investment in airpower, ballistic missile defense, a fully equipped, NATO standard heavy division,” say Dickson and Holowinsky. Meanwhile, they add: “Zelensky must take a strategic long view understanding that the lost territories in reality represent a gangrenous limb that must be cut off to save the healthy body.” At an absolute minimum Moscow will demand that Ukraine cedes the territory it has lost and abandon its drive to join NATO, which Trump believes was a provocation to Russia. Instead, Kyiv would have to negotiate other guarantees, as Zelensky said in an interview on Italian television this past week, that would “prevent Russia from returning with aggression.” But the Kremlin is likely to demand much more. Kyiv is “expected to accept extensive limitations on the size of its armed forces and on the kinds of weapons systems it is allowed to possess. These proposals are not a recipe for a sustainable settlement,” according to the Atlantic Council’s Serhii Kuzan. Moscow has shown no sign of abandoning its maximalist demand for the totality of all four regions it claims to have annexed. “This would mean handing over large amounts of unoccupied Ukrainian territory including the city of Zaporizhzhia with a population of around three quarters of a million people,” notes Kuzan. For now, both the White House and many commentators see no desire by either side to begin talks. “There is no expectation now that either side is ready for negotiations,” US National Security spokesman John Kirby said in recent days. While both the Kremlin and Trump have expressed readiness for a summit, premature efforts to advance negotiations on the Ukraine conflict could backfire, according to Russian commentator Giorgy Bovt. “If the meeting is held prematurely, when the conditions for peace are not yet ripe, it will do more harm than good. It could lead to an even greater escalation. At the same time, both warring sides are still betting on the continuation of hostilities, not considering their forces exhausted,” he wrote on Telegram."
Zelensky offers to release captured North Korean soldiers in exchange for Ukrainian soldiers held in Russia,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/europe/north-korean-soldiers-interrogation-video-ukraine-intl-latam/index.html,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he is willing to release North Korean soldiers captured by Ukraine in the Kursk region of Russia in exchange for Ukrainian soldiers being held captive in Russia. “Ukraine is ready to hand over (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un’s soldiers to him if he can organize their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia,” Zelensky said Sunday in a post on X that included a video purportedly showing two North Korean POWs being interrogated. On Saturday, Ukraine said it had captured two North Korean soldiers, marking the first time that Kyiv has captured soldiers alive from the isolated state. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have officially acknowledged the presence of North Korean troops in Russia. CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment, and is seeking comment from North Korea. In the video shared by Zelensky on Sunday, both soldiers appear injured and are likely speaking under duress. A Korean-speaking voice can be heard translating questions from the interrogator. One soldier has a wound to his jaw, the other has bandaged hands. One of the soldiers, who appears in the video lying down, says he did not know he was fighting in a war against Ukraine and that his commanders told him it was a training exercise. The interrogator, whose voice has been modulated to obscure their identity, asks both soldiers whether they want to return to North Korea, according to a CNN translation of the video. One nods, the other – after further prompting from the translator, who asks, “Do you like it here in Ukraine? It’s nicer here” – says he wants to stay in Ukraine but adds later that he will do as he is told. In his daily address later Sunday, Zelensky claimed that one of the soldiers had “expressed a desire to stay in Ukraine.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was tight-lipped about Zelensky’s offer to swap the captured North Koreans for Ukrainian prisoners taken by Russia, but said the Kremlin was “interested” in discussing potential exchanges. “We do not know what is true here, who offered what to whom,” Peskov said Monday. “The process is not easy. But the life of each of our soldiers in captivity is important to us. This work will continue.” According to Ukrainian and Western assessments, some 11,000 North Korean troops are deployed in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces occupy several hundred square kilometers after staging a cross-border incursion in August last year. Ukraine estimates more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in Kursk, while a senior US official said North Korea has seen “several hundred” casualties – both killed and wounded – in the region since October. On Monday, South Korean lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun, who was briefed by the National Intelligence Service, said about 300 North Korean soldiers sent to Russia are believed to have died so far with 2,700 injured. In video released Saturday by Ukraine’s Security Service, a spokesman says one of the North Koreans was captured on January 9 by Ukrainian special forces, and the other by Ukrainian paratroopers. In his statement on X, Zelensky vowed to capture more North Korean soldiers. “In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be more. It’s only a matter of time before our troops manage to capture others. There should be no doubt left in the world that the Russian army is dependent on military assistance from North Korea,” Zelensky said on X. Officials in Kyiv have accused Russia of trying to cover up the involvement of North Korean soldiers on the battlefield."
Croatia’s President Milanović wins another term after defeating ruling party candidate in runoff,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/europe/croatia-milanovic-wins-election-runoff-intl-latam/index.html,"Croatia’s opposition-backed President Zoran Milanović, a critic of the European Union and NATO, overwhelmingly won reelection for another five-year term on Sunday, defeating a candidate from the ruling conservative party in a runoff vote, official results showed. Milanović won more than 74% of the vote compared to his challenger Dragan Primorac, who received nearly 26%, according to the results released by Croatia’s state election authorities after more than 99% of the ballots were counted. The result presents a major boost for Milanović, who is a critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Milanović is also a fierce opponent of Croatia’s conservative Prime Minister Andrej Plenković and his government. In a speech after the results were released, Milanović said his victory was a sign of approval and trust from the voters but also presented a message “about the state of affairs in the country for those who need to hear it.” “I am asking them (the government) to hear it,” said Milanovic. “That is what the citizens wanted to say. This is not just support for me.” Milanović, 58, is the most popular politician in Croatia, and is sometimes compared to US President-elect Donald Trump for his combative style of communication with political opponents. His triumph sets the stage for a continued political confrontation with PM Plenković, with whom he sparred during his first term. Milanović also won comfortably in the first round of voting on Dec. 29, leaving Primorac, a forensic scientist who had unsuccessfully run for president previously, and six other candidates far behind. The runoff between the top two contenders was necessary because Milanović fell short of securing 50% of the vote by just 5,000 votes, while Primorac trailed far behind with 19%. The election was held as Croatia, which has a population of 3.8 million, struggles with biting inflation, corruption scandals and a labor shortage. Upon voting on Sunday, Milanović again criticized the EU as “in many ways non-democratic” and run by unelected officials. The EU position that “if you don’t think the same as I do, then you’re the enemy” amounts to “mental violence,” Milanović said. “That’s not the modern Europe I want to live and work in,” he said. “I will work on changing it, as much as I can as the president of a small nation.” Milanović served as prime minister in the past with a mixed record. He regularly accuses Plenković and his conservative HDZ of systemic corruption, while Plenković has labeled Milanović “pro-Russian” and a threat to Croatia’s international standing. Political analyst Višeslav Raos said the increasingly outspoken Milanović has no motive to “try to please someone or try to control himself.” “If there was no cooperation with the prime minister for the first five years (of his presidency), why would there be now?” he said. Though the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme military commander. Milanović denied he is pro-Russian but last year, he blocked the dispatch of five Croatian officers to NATO’s mission in Germany called Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine. He also pledged he would never approve sending Croatian soldiers as part of any NATO mission to Ukraine. Plenković and his government say there is no such proposal. Despite limited powers, many believe the presidential position is key for the political balance of power in a country mainly governed by the Croatian Democratic Union, or HDZ, since gaining independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Primorac, 59, entered politics in the early 2000s, when he was science and education minister in the HDZ-led government. He unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 2009, and after that mainly focused on his academic career including lecturing at universities in the United States, China and in Croatia."
Six killed in explosion at Czech restaurant,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/europe/czech-restaurant-explosion-intl/index.html,"Six people died when a propane-butane cylinder exploded at a restaurant in the northwest Czech city of Most, setting the building on fire, emergency services said on Sunday. Eight people were injured in the fiery blast that occurred late on Saturday evening, and 30 people were evacuated from the restaurant and surrounding buildings, the Czech fire rescue service said on X social media platform. “According to initial information from witnesses, a heater overturned, causing a fire,” the fire brigade said. Interior Minister Vit Rakusan told Czech Radio the cause was likely a propane-butane heater overturning in the restaurant’s front garden. The fire brigade said it had rescued one seriously injured restaurant guest who had been trapped in a bathroom. Around 20 guests were in the restaurant at the time of the explosion, Czech Radio said."
"Dozens injured as trams collide in Strasbourg, France",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/europe/trams-collide-strasbourg-france-intl-latam/index.html,"Two trams collided in Strasbourg in eastern France on Saturday, causing dozens of injuries, though none critical, authorities said. The accident took place during the afternoon in a tunnel leading to the station near the city’s central train station. An additional 100 people, though uninjured, were assessed for shock or stress, said René Cellier, director of the Bas-Rhin Fire and Rescue Service. Emergency services deployed 130 firefighters, 50 rescue vehicles and established a wide safety perimeter. “Around 50 people are in a state of relative emergency, with injuries such as scalp wounds, clavicle fractures and knee sprains. But there are no critical injuries. It could have been much worse,” Cellier said. The exact cause of the collision was unclear but local media reported that one of the trams was reversing at the time. Mayor Jeanne Barseghian, who visited the site, described the incident as a “brutal collision” and expressed her gratitude to emergency responders. “I am at the station with the injured and rescuers. Thank you for your mobilization,” she said on X. She urged the public not to obstruct rescue operations. Images shared on social media showed two severely damaged tram cars, one of which had derailed in the tunnel. Strasbourg, the first major French city to reinstate tram services in 1994, had not experienced a significant tram accident until now, according to French media. Authorities launched an investigation to determine what caused the collision. Cleanup operations continued Saturday evening, and residents were advised to avoid the area around the train station."
"US officials say Gaza ceasefire deal is in sight, the first sign of serious optimism in months",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/middleeast/israel-hamas-deal-talks-intl/index.html,"American officials believe a ceasefire and hostages release deal in the Israel-Hamas war is now in sight, in what marks the first real sign of serious optimism inside the Biden administration in months, sources familiar with the issue told CNN. While they continued to emphasize that officials will remain cautious until the negotiations produce a final deal to end the Gaza conflict, as of Monday, the sources said US officials believe a ceasefire agreement could very well be announced in the forthcoming last days of President Joe Biden’s time in office. Other sources told CNN that Israel, Hamas and the mediators were working through the final elements of an emerging deal. “Now the final draft is being discussed by both parties, and each party is informing the mediators of its position,” a Hamas official told CNN. Another source said that “all the big blocks (to a deal) have been resolved.” US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told CNN earlier on Monday that “there has been significant progress made.” “I am not going to sit here and make predictions – this has been a long time coming,” Finer said. “Fundamentally, we believe there is progress being made. There is a deal on the table that Hamas should accept.” It comes as a Hamas official said Monday morning that the group is “very close to an agreement” with Israel. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar also announced some progress, saying Monday that Israel is working hard to reach a deal in the ongoing negotiations being hosted in the Qatari capital of Doha, and that “progress was made.” “Israel wants a hostage deal. Israel is working with our American friends in order to achieve a hostage deal, and soon we will know whether the other side wants the same thing,” Saar said in a news conference in Jerusalem. Several sticking points remain, however, the Hamas official told CNN. They include Hamas’ demands that Israel withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land along the Egypt-Gaza border, and commit to a permanent ceasefire rather than a temporary halt to the military operations launched in the wake of the Hamas October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. Disagreement also remains over an Israeli-proposed buffer zone inside Gaza to run along the strip’s eastern and northern borders with Israel. The official said that Hamas wants the buffer zone to return to the pre-October 7 size of 300-500 meters (330-545 yards) from the border line, while Israel is requesting a much larger 2,000-meter depth. “We believe this means that 60 km (37 miles) of the Gaza Strip will remain under their control, and displaced people will not return to their homes,” the official said. Beyond those key demands, the Hamas official said that negotiators were hammering out specific details of the release of Palestinian prisoners and maps covering the areas from which Israeli forces would withdraw. The Hamas official told CNN earlier that Israel’s response to Hamas’ sticking points for a deal has been “mostly positive.” Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees, told CNN separately on Monday that he is traveling to Doha to advise negotiators on the list of detainees to be released “in the event the deal materializes.” The optimistic tone was tempered though by Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who said Monday that the potential ceasefire-hostage deal would be a “catastrophe” for Israel’s national security. In a post on X, Smotrich described it as a “surrender deal” that would include releasing “terrorists” and “dissolving” the war’s achievements. On Monday, 10 members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party sent a letter to the Israeli prime minister expressing concern about a potential agreement and reiterating three “red lines” should not be crossed. The Knesset members argued that Israel should not have to rely on others for security, all hostages must be returned and a mass return to northern Gaza should be prevented in any framework for a deal. Netanyahu spoke with US President Joe Biden on Sunday, their first publicly announced call since October, about the progress in negotiations. Netanyahu, who met with President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, on Saturday, is facing pressure from both the current and incoming US administrations to reach a deal. Witkoff and Biden’s Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk, who are both currently in the region, have been working together in recent days with mediators to try to resolve some of the last remaining sticking points to get to the ceasefire deal, sources told CNN. The two US envoys have also had joint phone calls with Netanyahu. Meanwhile, Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan has been in close consultation with top Israeli officials, including David Barnea, and Qatar’s prime minister, on Monday, per sources. A source with knowledge of the ceasefire-hostage talks told CNN Monday that Trump is the incentive for Israel to strike a deal with Hamas. The source said Netanyahu “wants to remain close to Trump.” “There’s a bigger picture here that he (Netanyahu) wants to achieve. And you know, remaining on track with Trump is important. That’s the thing,” the source added. They said that even if there is no deal by January 20, when Trump will be sworn in as president, then “we have to get to a framework” by that date. On Monday US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan struck an optimistic tone, saying the two sides were inching closer to a potential deal and that it could “get done this week.” “I’m not making a promise or a prediction, but it is there for the taking, and we are going to work to make it happen,” he told reporters at the White House Monday. Finer said Monday that some remaining differences that were present in recent weeks “have been resolved or narrowed.” Since the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, the death toll from Israeli military action in Gaza has risen to 46,584, with 109,731 people injured, according to the latest daily report from the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The report added that a number of victims are still under the rubble and on roads, and ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them. Meanwhile, a peer-reviewed study by researchers from a leading health research university in the UK found the number of people killed in Gaza is significantly higher than the figure reported by authorities in the enclave. On Monday, Israeli strikes on northern Gaza killed more than 40 people and injured dozens, a Gaza civil defense spokesperson said. “The bombing and killing have not stopped since dawn today,” Mahmoud Basal told CNN. Gazans who spoke to CNN on Monday said they hoped negotiations could end the war, but they fear announcements of progress towards a deal are all “empty” promises. “Every time they say there are negotiations, we hear nothing but their failure,” said Khan Younis resident Abdul Rahman Salama, who spoke to CNN as he was trying to recover items from the rubble of his destroyed house. “The destruction is unreal. I hope the war stops as suddenly as it started; it will end suddenly, but the negotiations are all empty talk — lies upon lies.” Ahmad Salama, another man displaced from Khan Younis, said: “My family hopes that the negotiations will succeed so the war will end, and we can return to safety, and the fear and terror will stop, and we won’t have to flee from one place to another with the children and my mother again.” The war in Gaza has also exacted a heavy toll on Israeli forces. At least 15 Israeli soldiers have been killed in northern Gaza in the past week, according to the Israeli military."
Top ICJ judge Nawaf Salam named Lebanon’s next prime minister,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/middleeast/icj-judge-nawaf-salam-lebanon-prime-minister-intl/index.html,"The top judge at the International Court of Justice Nawaf Salam has been designated Lebanon’s next prime minister in a surprising turnaround for the crisis-ridden country. On Monday, the office of newly minted President Joseph Aoun asked Salam to form a government, after the judge was endorsed by a large majority of lawmakers during consultations with Aoun. Aoun’s election and Salam’s designation mark the end of a more than two-year long stalemate with a presidential vacuum and a cabinet operating in a day-to-day caretaker capacity. The consultations over the country’s next prime minister were triggered by Aoun’s election in parliament on Thursday, following a robust push from Saudi Arabia. Salam is widely viewed as a reformist. He is a Sunni Muslim – the only sect allowed the position of prime minister – and was a candidate for the premiership twice before in recent years. The judge rose to international prominence last year after he was elected head of the ICJ, presiding over South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide and other tribunals. Some media outlets likened Salam’s designation to a “tsunami.” He put himself forward as a candidate on Sunday morning, according to local media reports. Prior to that, incumbent caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati was widely viewed as the most likely contender for the post. Salam’s designation is a blow to Hezbollah and its allies Amal, known as the Shia duo, who are believed to have supported Mikati. Speaking to reporters, Hezbollah parliamentary bloc leader Mohammad Raad said the move to designate Salam sowed “division” in the country, and said he hoped the cabinet would respect the country’s confessional power-sharing “pact.” Unofficially, Lebanon’s major sects – Muslims from Sunni and Shia sects as well as Christians – must all be represented in cabinet. No Shia lawmakers endorsed the prime minister designate, putting Nawaf on a potential collision course as he tries to form a government in the next few weeks."
Netanyahu and Biden discuss progress in Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal talks,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/middleeast/netanyahu-biden-ceasefire-hostages-talks-intl-latam/index.html,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken with US President Joe Biden about the progress in negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal. “The prime minister discussed with the American president the progress in the negotiations to release our hostages and updated him on the mandate he gave to the negotiating team to Doha in order to advance the release of our hostages,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement about the call on Sunday. It added, “the prime minister wanted to thank the American President (Joe) Biden and the incoming President Donald Trump for their cooperation for the holy mission.” The White House said Biden and Netanyahu discussed the negotiations in Doha, based on the proposal the US president laid out in May. Biden once again called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the return of the hostages and increased humanitarian aid to the enclave. Biden also spoke to Netanyahu about the “fundamentally changed regional circumstances” following the ceasefire in Lebanon in November last year, the collapse of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime the following month, and Iran’s weakened position in the region, the White House said. This is the first publicly announced call between the two men since October 2024, and it comes as Netanyahu summoned two major critics of Biden’s ceasefire deal proposal to meetings to discuss a potential deal. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir have previously rejected a peace proposal laid out by Biden in May of last year, which would pair a release of hostages with a “full and complete ceasefire.” Both ministers rejected the idea of an immediate ceasefire and have called for fighting to continue until Hamas is destroyed and all hostages are returned. The far-right ministers have previously threatened to resign and topple Netanyahu’s governing coalition if he accepted Biden’s proposal. The meetings with the Israeli cabinet members on Sunday come as Israeli negotiators have expressed “cautious optimism” at the talks ongoing in Doha this weekend, which involve a high-level Israeli delegation including Mossad chief David Barnea. Netanyahu, who met with Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, on Saturday, is facing pressure from both the current and incoming US administrations to reach a deal. Last week, Witkoff touted progress made at the Doha talks and expressed optimism about making gains by the time of Trump’s inauguration on January 20, though a senior administration official said talks remained difficult. Trump himself has said there would be “hell to pay” in the Middle East if the hostages are not released by the time he is sworn into office. His incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz told ABC on Sunday said he wants to see some type of agreement before inauguration. “I want to see (the hostages) walking across the tarmac, or at a minimum, some type of agreement before the inauguration because President Trump is serious,” Waltz said. Waltz also said Hamas was “completely isolated” and has “to enter into some type of agreement.” The Biden administration said earlier Sunday it was still working toward securing a hostage deal before the president leaves office. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday that while reaching a deal by January 20 is “possible,” he “cannot make any predictions.” “We are very, very close, and yet being very close still means we’re far, because until you actually get across the finish line, we’re not there,” Sullivan said on “State of the Union.” Sullivan said White House Middle East adviser Brett McGurk is still in Doha, “hammering out with the mediators the final details of a text to be presented to both sides.” In a December interview with CBS that aired Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that when an agreement is reached, it will be “on the basis of what President Biden put forward.” Meanwhile those close to the Israeli prime minister have stressed his commitment to securing a deal. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar emphasized Israel’s aim to secure a hostage deal as he welcomed his British counterpart to Jerusalem on Sunday. And Netanyahu spokesperson Omer Dostri told Israeli outlet Channel 14 that the government was making “every effort” to reach a deal but there had been “slow progress.” “In the end, it depends on Hamas,” he said on Sunday, pushing back against critics who have claimed Netanyahu didn’t want a deal. “I am in various discussions and I can tell you the prime minister works on this 24-seven, holds discussions into the night, conversations with leaders,” he said. “When I hear all kinds of sources saying that the prime minister does not want to return our hostages home, I tell you, this tears me apart. The prime minister wants a deal.” This is a developing story and will be updated."
‘Cautious optimism’ as Mossad chief arrives in Qatar for ceasefire-for-hostages talks,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/middleeast/israel-mossad-chief-qatar-hostage-talks-intl-latam/index.html,"Israeli negotiators attending ceasefire and hostage release talks in Doha have expressed “cautious optimism,” even as some gaps between both sides persist, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. A high-level Israeli delegation, which includes Mossad director David Barnea, arrived in Doha, following clear signs of progress in the hostage and ceasefire negotiations. The areas where daylight remains between the two sides are the Philadelphi corridor – a narrow strip of land along the Egypt-Gaza border – and the presence of the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza, as well as phrasing concerning the end of the war, according to the source. Israel has long demanded that its troops remain along the Philadelphi corridor, while Hamas insists that they withdraw. The disagreement over that narrow but strategic piece of land was a key reason for the collapse of previous talks in August last year. Gaps also remain between the Hamas leadership in Gaza and the group’s leadership abroad, the source also explained. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who met with US President-elect Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday, is facing pressure from both the current and incoming US administrations to reach a deal by January 20. Despite that pressure, the source said the decision to send the high-level delegation to talks in Doha was made because most parties involved in negotiations really want a deal, adding that conditions are ripe. “American pressure had little to do with it,” the source claimed. But pressure from the United States is clearly being felt inside the Israeli government, an Israeli official acknowledged to CNN on Saturday. The Israeli delegation also includes Nitzan Alon, the head of the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) hostages unit and Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency. Negotiations have appeared deadlocked for months, despite the efforts of the outgoing US President Joe Biden. Trump, meanwhile, has warned that “all hell will break out” if the hostages are not released by his inauguration on January 20. The Hostages Families Forum welcomed the decision to send the Israeli delegation, describing the move as “a historic opportunity to secure the release of all our loved ones.” “Leave no stone unturned and return with an agreement that ensures the return of all hostages, down to the last one,” the forum said in a statement on Saturday. The optimism comes even as Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza continues to rage, with the IDF on Saturday announcing the deaths of four soldiers in combat in the north of the enclave. Israel launched the war in response to the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, that killed more than 1,200 people and saw more than 250 taken hostage. Since then, at least 46,537 Palestinians have been killed and more than 109,571 people injured, according to health authorities in Gaza. While dozens of hostages were released as part of a short-lived hostages-for-ceasefire deal in November 2023, the Israeli government believes 98 hostages are still being held in Gaza – nearly all of whom were taken on October 7, 2023, and dozens of whom are believed to be dead. Growing frustration over the lack of progress since the 2023 deal has seen protesters regularly take to the streets in Israel. On Saturday, protests took place in several locations, including Tel Aviv, where some demonstrators marched through the city center with signs calling for the end of the war and saying “weak leaders wage pointless wars.” At the weekly rally at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, Shira Albag – whose 19-year-old daughter Liri Albag appeared in a recent “proof of life” hostage video released by Hamas – demanded an immediate deal as she addressed the crowd. “I stand here, exactly one week after receiving proof of life from my Liri, and my heart just wants to scream. Liri, our light, just 19 years old – a child with her whole life ahead of her – is there, in captivity, in hell,” Albag said. “A deal now!” she demanded, adding, “Liri is alive, and she will return home alive!” US Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew and UK Ambassador to Israel Simon Walters also addressed the crowd. “Tonight, as Israel’s close friends and allies, we reaffirm our commitment to helping reach a breakthrough that will bring the hostages home and bring a better future for the people of this region,” Lew said. Walters added: “Hamas bears full responsibility for these crimes. But practically, we know that the only way to bring all the hostages home is through negotiation.” Meanwhile, the mother and father of Itay Chen, one of the seven dual US-Israeli citizens still held by Hamas, visited Qatar in person this week to speak with negotiators. Chen is dead but his body has not been recovered or returned. “We went to Qatar because we don’t have full confidence in our representatives in the negotiations and wished to convey the families’ position to the US and Qatar facilitators,” Ruby Chen told CNN on Saturday. CNN’s Jeremy Diamond and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report."
Watershed moment for the Middle East after Lebanon elects new president - with a Saudi push,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/middleeast/lebanon-aoun-president-saudi-push-intl/index.html,"It was a last-minute push by Saudi Arabia that decided Lebanon’s fate on Thursday. There were less than 24 hours before parliament was set to choose the next president. But Lebanon’s checkered political landscape was in total disarray. The sectarian political elite seemed to be stuck at the drawing board. Presidents in Lebanon are brought to power by near political consensus, but more than six contenders were still in play. Debates were heated and army chief Joseph Aoun was dismissed by many politicians as constitutionally unqualified for the presidency because of his military post. It looked like parliament was heading for its 13th failed attempt to elect a president in more than two years. Then, a Saudi delegation headed by the kingdom’s envoy, Prince Yazid bin Farhan, flew into Beirut for the second time in a week. It held a blitz of meetings with various political parties. By the time they left, there was only one candidate left: the US-backed Aoun. Ninety-nine lawmakers voted for Aoun, surpassing the requisite two-thirds of Parliament. The remaining 29 ballots were largely either blank or disqualified (one of the lawmakers cast his vote for “Bernie Sanders”). Within minutes, Aoun arrived in parliament, having swapped his army fatigues for a suit and tie. He took an oath and gave an Earth-shattering, seemingly well-rehearsed speech, vowing to usher in Lebanon’s “new era” and monopolize weapons under the aegis of the state. In other words, Hezbollah, one of the world’s best armed militant groups for the better part of the last 40 years, was set to be disarmed. Jubilation filled the streets. A presidential vacuum had been filled. A years-long stalemate between the confessional elite had broken - for the time-being at least. But it was a development that raised larger questions. Why had Saudi Arabia expended so much diplomatic capital to deliver a president, ending nearly eight years of disengagement from Lebanon that it dismissed as “lost” to Iranian domination via Hezbollah? Another factor that unlocked the Aoun presidency is also significant: Hezbollah and its allies in the Amal party voted for him. It was a highly choreographed affair. Hezbollah and Amal, known as the Shia duo, cast blank votes in the first round of voting, which failed to produce a president. During a two-hour recess, the heads of their respective parliamentary blocs held a meeting with Aoun, the details of which are unknown. After returning to parliament, they cast their ballots for Aoun, breaking the deadlock and opening the path to the presidency. The message was clear. Hezbollah may have been severely weakened by its war with Israel in the fall, and by the recent toppling of its key ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but it could still prolong a stalemate, or end it. Why, however, had they voted for a president with a mandate to disarm them? It is unclear what happened during the meetings where Saudi Arabia corralled overwhelming support for Aoun. But it was a full-throated effort that happened in tandem with Western diplomatic talks. France’s special envoy to Lebanon Jean-Yves Le Drian had also met with Hezbollah lawmakers. France is one of the few Western countries that does not have a wholesale terror designation on Hezbollah, maintaining a diplomatic channel with the militant group’s political arm. It’s one of the only remaining links between the West and the Iran-backed group. Earlier this week, US Special Envoy to Lebanon Amos Hochstein was also doing his part to prop up Aoun’s chances with a flurry of meetings. None of this was lost on Lebanon’s lawmakers. “We’re not here to elect a president,” independent MP Jamil el-Sayyed told local TV station Al-Jadeed from parliament on Tuesday. “We’re here to certify the appointment of a president.” In comments before the casting of ballots, anti-establishment lawmaker Halime El Kaakour gestured to the upper gallery where foreign dignitaries – including the American, French, Egyptian and Iranian ambassadors – sat. “No one should impose their will on us, not the tutelage of the Iranians, nor the Syrians, nor the Americans. We shouldn’t replace  one (external) guardianship with another,” she said. “No one should interfere with our internal affairs, with all my respect to the ambassadors here,” she continued. “We support international cooperation… but no one should interfere with our sovereignty.” Aoun’s predecessor is the Hezbollah-backed former President Michel Aoun (the two are not related). His tenure, which ended more than two years ago, was widely seen as an era of Iranian domination in Lebanon, which saw an unprecedented surge in Hezbollah’s political power. That shift in external backing between the two President Aouns is a seismic change for the country. Yet Hezbollah appears to be meeting this moment with a quiet and mysterious resignation. In his remarks to reporters after Aoun’s election, Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc leader Mohammad Raad said they voted for him to promote “national understanding.” They withheld their vote in the first round, he added ambiguously, because they “wanted to send a message… that we are protectors of sovereignty.” Strategic ambiguity may be the best card it holds at this pivotal moment. The militant group received a rapid succession of body blows during the two-month war with Israel in the fall, including with the killing of its long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah. The ousting of Assad, who had opened his territory to the group’s supply lines with Iran, severely limited its ability to rearm. The group has also agreed to withdraw its fighters from southern Lebanon, its powerbase for four decades and its primary battlefield with Israel, which occupied the area from 1978 to 2000, and which continues to be considered an enemy state by Lebanon. Yet the disarmament is far from complete. Hezbollah is still believed to possess medium- and long-range missiles, and it continues to command a broad Shia support base. This means that there’s likely to be longer negotiations over their arms, undoubtedly roping in external forces. This will also be a test of the nearly two-year -long rapprochement between Riyadh and Tehran. Domestically, Lebanon’s newly minted president must oversee this process while preventing the outbreak of civil strife, something he hinted at in his acceptance speech when he promised to stop the country’s factions from trying “to break each other’s heads.” Meanwhile, Israeli forces still operate in some parts of south Lebanon. The government in Israel has threatened to keep the military there beyond the deadline at the end of this month as stipulated by the US-brokered ceasefire agreement that ended the war in late November. Aoun has promised to force their withdrawal, a responsibility he said would fall to the state alone. These are uncharted waters for the tiny and troubled eastern Mediterranean country. But for many here, there’s reason for optimism. “Lebanon finally has a president who brings to the Lebanese people and international community both humane leadership and statehood legitimacy,” said Lynn Zovighian, a columnist, philanthropist and founder at social investment platform Zovighian Partnership. “It is time for leadership, constitutional order, a strengthened state, and humanization so that we can finally achieve socio-economic prosperity, justice, and accountability,” Zovighian told CNN."
"Israel identifies body of hostage recovered from Gaza, days after father’s remains were found",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/middleeast/israel-identifies-body-of-hostage-recovered-from-gaza-intl/index.html,"The Israeli military said Friday it had identified the body of a hostage recovered from a tunnel in southern Gaza as the son of Yosef Al-Ziyadnah, a hostage whose body was recovered earlier this week. Hamza Al-Ziyadnah, 23, was found dead in a tunnel in the Rafah area, a joint statement from the Israel Defense Forces and Internal Security Agency, known as Shin Bet, said on Friday. The Israeli military said Wednesday it had recovered the body of Yousef Al-Ziyadnah, 53, from a tunnel in the Rafah area and had discovered evidence that raised “grave concerns” for his son’s life. Hamza and his father were kidnapped during the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and had been held in the Gaza Strip. “Hamza and Yosef were abducted alive on October 7 and were killed while in Hamas captivity,” the statement said. The Al-Ziyadnah family are part of the Bedouin Muslim-Arab community that lives in southern Israel’s Negev desert. Yousef and three of his children – Hamza, Bilal, and Aysha – were taken from Kibbutz Holit in southwest Israel, where they used to work. Bilal and Aysha were among the dozens of hostages returned in the short-lived ceasefire deal in November 2023. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed grief at the news of Hamza’s death and again called for a deal to release the remaining hostages held in Gaza. “Yosef and Hamza, who survived a period in the hell of Gaza captivity, could have been saved through an earlier agreement,” the statement said. “The time and conditions are ripe for all the hostages to return – bringing the living home for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial,” it said. “The negotiations must be expedited to secure an immediate deal for their return. This historic window of opportunity stands before us and must not be lost.” Talks over a potential hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza appear deadlocked, with Hamas claiming that Israel has introduced new conditions and Egyptian mediators sounding downbeat about progress. A Hamas official told CNN on Friday that Israel has demanded holding on to a 1-kilometer strip of territory along the eastern and northern borders of the enclave. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was responding to a report by Reuters citing an unnamed Palestinian official about the alleged new condition. “Israel still insists on keeping a 1 km landscape along the eastern and northern borders of the Gaza Strip, which will restrict the return of residents to their homes and represent a retreat from what it (Israel) had agreed upon in July,” the official told Reuters. The Hamas official who spoke to CNN said Israel’s conditions included “much more” but did not offer further details. CNN has reached out to Israel about the claims. Meanwhile, an Egyptian official and another diplomat briefed on the matter told CNN on Friday that the indirect talks between Hamas and Israel in Qatar have yet to reach a breakthrough, despite statements from United States officials indicating that they were progressing. “There is a clear appetite on the part of the Americans to get a deal done for the incoming Trump administration,” the diplomat said. But the diplomat sounded a note of caution: “Things are going well but there is still a lot of work to do.” The comments come a day after US President Joe Biden said he met with negotiators and added that his assessment was that there was “real progress” being made. We’re making some real progress. I met with negotiators today,” Biden said. “Hope springs eternal, but I think I’m still hopeful that we’ll be able to have a prisoner exchange. Hamas is the one getting in the way of that exchange, right now.” US President-elect Donald Trump warned in a press conference this week that if the hostages Hamas is holding in Gaza are not released by his inauguration on January 20, “all hell will break out in the Middle East.” Ninety-eight hostages are still being held in Gaza, including 36 who are presumed to be dead, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s pick for special envoy to the Middle East, told reporters Wednesday he will be travelling to Qatar for the talks, saying negotiators are “making a lot of progress,.”  and appeared to suggest that a deal before January 20 was realistic. However, a senior Biden administration official struck a more cautious tone, telling CNN that the negotiations remain “difficult.” US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators are in the Qatari capital Doha in their latest push to close a deal between Hamas and Israel after more than a year of failed negotiations."

Sudanese army enters strategic city held by RSF rebel group for over a year,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/africa/sudanese-army-retakes-wad-madani-rsf-intl/index.html,"Sudan’s army said on Saturday it had entered the central city of Wad Madani and was pushing out its paramilitary rivals the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a step which if completed successfully would be its biggest gain in near two years of war. The army posted a video appearing to show troops inside the city, which is the capital of El Gezira state, an agricultural and trading hub that has been held by the RSF since December 2023. Recapture of the state as a whole could mark a turning point in the war that began in April 2023 over disputes on the integration of the two forces, which has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises with the displacement of more than 12 million people and half the population facing hunger. “The leadership of the Armed Forces congratulates our people on the entry of our forces into Wad Madani this morning. They are now working to clean up the remaining rebel pockets inside the city,” an army statement said. The state, located in the center of the country and south of the capital Khartoum has seen some of the RSF’s bloodiest attacks on civilians, as well as the burning of fields, looting of hospitals and markets, and flooding of irrigation ditches. Despite a long history as an agricultural trade hub, Madani has been marked by experts as an area at risk of famine due to the blockades imposed as part of the conflict. The army had stepped up its campaign to retake El Gezira in recent months, after retaking Sennar state in the south, including by increasing airstrikes that have often hit civilians. The RSF’s top commander in the state defected to the army in October, and his troops took part in Saturday’s operations, though the RSF responded at the time with a series of attacks. The army also on Saturday continued its operations on the city of Bahri, part of the greater capital, where it has also made advances in recent months. The RSF controls most of the west of the country, where it is fighting the army for al-Fashir, its last stronghold in the Darfur region. The two forces are also actively fighting over White Nile state in the south of the country."
Genocide is declared once more in Sudan. How did the country get here?,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/africa/sudan-genocide-explained/index.html,"This week, the United States accused the RSF militia in Sudan’s brutal civil conflict of committing genocide. It’s the second time in two decades that genocide has been declared in the northeast African nation, where thousands have died and millions are in the grip of a humanitarian crisis. For 20 months, two of Sudan’s most powerful generals – Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who heads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – have viciously competed for territory in a country still reeling from the massacre of tens of thousands of people in the early 2000s and the displacement of millions more. The two men – former allies – jointly ousted President Omar al-Bashir from office in 2019. Together, they also contributed to another coup in 2021 when al-Burhan seized power from the country’s transitional government. Today, Sudan is riven by conflict, with the RSF believed to be in control of much of the country’s western and central regions, including Darfur and parts of the capital Khartoum. More than 11 million people have been internally displaced since the fighting erupted in April 2023, according to the United Nations, while millions more have fled Sudan. Hunger is widespread and famine conditions are now present in several areas of the country, the UN has warned. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Hemedti’s RSF and its allied Arab militias had perpetrated “direct attacks against civilians” including the systematic murder of “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis.” They also “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,” Blinken said, adding that the same forces “targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.” “Based on this information, I have now concluded that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan,” he announced. The RSF described the decision by the US as “unjust,” adding in a statement on its Telegram channel that “the State Department’s claim that the RSF committed genocide in Sudan is inaccurate.” “The decision fails to specify the group against which the alleged genocide was committed or the location of the genocide … The decision vaguely refers to the Sudanese people, of whom RSF fighters and supporters are an integral part,” the RSF statement said. The RSF has a history connected to ethnic-driven violence. The paramilitary group grew out of the Arab Janjaweed militia that oversaw the genocide of the early 2000s. That carnage left an estimated 300,000 people dead. Since fighting erupted in mid-April 2023 between the RSF and the SAF,  ethnically motivated killings have intensified, particularly in the western Darfur region. This mirrors the pattern of targeted killings that typified the first genocide. West Darfur witnessed some of its worst ethnic-related killings in 2023, when hundreds of people from non-Arab ethnic groups were massacred by the RSF and forces linked to it. On Tuesday, the US imposed sanctions on their leader Hemedti, “for his role in systematic atrocities committed against the Sudanese people,” and sanctioned seven RSF-linked companies and one individual “for their roles in procuring weapons for the RSF.” In September last year, a United Nations fact-finding mission accused both the SAF and the RSF of complicity in war crimes. And in his statement, Blinken laid blame for abuses at the door of both parties. “The United States does not support either side of this war, and these actions against Hemedti and the RSF do not signify support or favor for the SAF,” he said. “Both belligerents bear responsibility for the violence and suffering in Sudan and lack the legitimacy to govern a future peaceful Sudan.” Sudanese activist, Hala Al-Karib, who heads the regional arm of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, told CNN that her organization had documented cases of sexual violence and sexual exploitation allegedly committed by fighters from both the SAF and the RSF. In Darfur, she said, where she has worked for over 20 years, sexual violence has been “used as a tool of terror to force communities to submit to the RSF,” – a pattern seen in previous conflicts that has been replicated by the militia group, she claimed. “It’s the same method and strategy,” she said of the alleged sexual crimes. “It’s also used for retaliation in their war against SAF and it has ethnic elements to it.” Al-Karib said that between October and January, her organization had handled cases of at least 10 girls, some as young as 14, who took their own lives after being gang-raped by RSF militia men in Sudan’s Al Jazira state. This had followed the defection of an RSF commander in the area to SAF, she said. “The RSF has been completely emboldened by impunity, a lack of accountability, and the fact that they were not seriously subjected to any sort of accountability,” she said, welcoming the US sanctions against Hemedti. Civilians and aid agencies have also borne the brunt of frequent shelling and staged raids by the Sudanese army and the RSF – targeting civilian areas and causing multiple casualties. Last month, more than 100 people were killed after bombs fell on a crowded market in North Darfur. In the same month, three staff members of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed in an airstrike on the agency’s office in Blue Nile State, wrapping up “the deadliest year on record for aid workers in Sudan,” the UN said. Dozens of airstrikes with multiple fatalities are reported daily by Sudanese media. A senior procurement official who led the SAF’s acquisition of arms was sanctioned by the US last October. The RSF and the Sudanese military typically blame one each other for such attacks, with a recent statement from the RSF criticizing the US for overlooking “widespread atrocities committed by the SAF, including aerial bombardments that have claimed the lives of more than 4,000 civilians.” CNN has reached out the Sudanese government on the matter but has not yet received a response. Before the deadly power tussle erupted between the SAF and the RSF, Sudan already ranked among the world’s poorest countries with decades of conflict hindering its economic growth. Their war, now in its second year, has displaced more than 11 million people within Sudan, while some 3.2 million others have fled to neighboring countries, according to UN figures. Some of those unable to flee are harbored in Darfur’s Zanzam camp, where famine was declared last month. The camp, home to around half a million displaced people, has also come under RSF bombardment. Hunger in Darfur has sometimes forced people to eat “grass and peanut shells” to survive, the then WFP regional director for Eastern Africa, Michael Dunford, said last year, amid warnings by the UN that some 26 million Sudanese were facing acute hunger. Food deliveries to Darfur resumed last August after a key border crossing was reopened by authorities for aid to enter Sudan. But in parts of Darfur, aid organizations are still impeded by restrictions and famine conditions area spreading to additional areas, a UN report said this week. On Friday, humanitarian group Médecins Sans Frontières, or, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was suspending activities at one of the last operating hospitals in the RSF-controlled south Khartoum, citing recurring attacks from armed fighters. “The medical needs are overwhelming. Injuries are often horrific. Mass casualty incidents have become almost routine,” MSF’s Emergency Coordinator, Claire San Filippo said in a statement. The Sudanese conflict has been largely overshadowed by hostilities in other parts of the world such as in Ukraine and Gaza, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said last year. However, warring factions in the African nation have also defied global efforts to end the conflict. Last month, Blinken told the UN Security Council that foreign actors were fueling the war in Sudan, but he did not name who they were. “To the foreign sponsors sending drones, missiles, mercenaries – enough. To those profiting off the illicit oil and gold trade that fund this conflict – enough,” he said. Sudan’s military government has frequently accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the RSF, but the Gulf nation denies this. The seven RSF-linked companies that were sanctioned by the US on Tuesday are all based in the UAE. In a statement to CNN, the UAE Foreign Ministry said: “The UAE has made absolutely clear that it is not providing any support or supplies to any of the two belligerent warring parties in Sudan. Our primary focus remains on addressing the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Sudan. We continue to call for an immediate ceasefire and a peaceful resolution to this man-made conflict.” A CNN investigation in 2023 found evidence that Russian mercenary group Wagner had been arming the RSF. The militia and the then Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, denied this at the time. In November, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called on Sudan’s warring factions to end the fighting, strengthen protections for civilians and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid. Sudan’s military-backed foreign ministry welcomed Russia’s action, saying the UN resolution undermined Sudan’s sovereignty. Sudanese lawyer Mutasim Ali told CNN that the US’ determination of genocide in Sudan was “long overdue” and should have happened sooner. Nonetheless, it is “a form of justice because it recognizes victims’ grievances,” he said. “It is a step towards peace and accountability by paving the way to hold actors responsible to account, not only perpetrators themselves but actors complicit in genocide,” added Ali, a legal adviser at the Canada-based Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. For activist Al-Karib, US sanctions against Hemedti and the declaration of genocide could be crucial in not only reining in his militia but also curbing the support he receives from foreign actors. “We don’t think that the scale of these atrocities happening in Sudan and Darfur would have been this big without the support of the UAE to the RSF,” she said. “So, we hope that the US decision to sanction Hemedti will send a strong message to the UAE to rethink its position and engage in a serious political process to end these atrocities and genocidal acts happening across the country.”"
Kenyan government critics mysteriously disappeared. They came back silenced,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/africa/kenya-government-critics-intl/index.html,"Gideon Kibet had just stepped off a bus on Christmas Eve when four masked men surrounded him and forced him into a car. The 24-year-old agriculture student says the men tore his shirt, used it to blindfold him and taunted him. Kibet is one of dozens of prominent anti-government critics to have gone missing since a youth-led protest movement erupted in June against a controversial finance bill. He was taken by the men after posting cartoons critical of Kenyan President William Ruto and his government to social media in December. “Bull,” as Kibet is known online, was released with four others Monday, just 10 days after Ruto promised to stop abductions of government critics. Ruto, government officials and police had maintained for months that there had been no abductions, calling them “fake news,” despite at least 82 government critics having gone missing since summer, according to the Kenya National Human Rights Commission. Even when acknowledging the abductions last month, Ruto did not take responsibility for the abductions of all those missing; he also urged parents to  “take care” of their children. The returned activists say that they still don’t know who held them, or where. But they all have said that they will no longer criticize the government on social media or have completely gone silent. “They have been intimidated and threatened into silence. They said so openly that they will tone down and won’t be as critical as before,” activist Hussein Khalid told CNN, underlining many human rights defenders’ concerns: that the government has succeeded in muzzling critical voices. Kenyan authorities have maintained that they are not behind the abductions, and the country’s police chief has said none of the disappeared was held in police stations. But Khalid, like many others, say all signs show otherwise. “Of course it’s the government, there’s no shred of doubt about that. You can’t abduct people in broad daylight with CCTV cameras. If it quacks like a duck, it is a duck,” Khalid said. All five people who were recently released were shaken by their experiences. CNN spoke with two of the young men who had been recently released, and with the family of another activist, while another activist spoke with local media, detailing the ordeal. All of the men said that they were shaken by their experiences. They described being held in solitary rooms, sometimes in darkness and with infrequent showers. Some say they were questioned about their online activities. All were returned without their phones. Kibet told CNN that his abductors asked him repeatedly “if I knew why I had been arrested.” He told his abductors that he believes he was taken because of his online activism. “One of my abductors told me: ‘so you’ve decided to be their Jesus, to sacrifice yourself for others?’” Kibet said. Kibet, like many young Kenyans, was once a fervent Ruto supporter. But he turned into a sharp online critic as the euphoria that propelled Ruto to power turned into disappointment with his government over corruption, high unemployment, and an anemic economy. Kibet’s younger brother Ronny Kiplangat – a teacher who hardly ever used social media – also went missing a few days before Kibet and was similarly released this week. The brothers believe that Kiplangat was abducted as a way to lure Kibet – who was studying outside the capital – to Nairobi. “It could be that they were trying to find my brother. I can’t really say they had a main reason for abducting me,” Kiplangat said. Kiplangat says he doesn’t know where he was detained as he was also blindfolded on his way in and out by a group of men. But upon his return this week, Kiplangat was dropped off before dawn in Machakos, nearly 100 kilometers (62 miles) from where he had been abducted, he said. Human rights groups say the abductions should be called enforced disappearances, and that they violate Kenyan and international law. Amnesty International Kenya’s executive director, Irungu Houghton, told CNN that the disappearances were well-calculated and organized. “It’s not the kind of thing that two or three rogue police officers could pull together, because they are operating essentially, in many cases, with weapons,” Houghton said. “They have vehicles that do not seem to have the correct license plates – that’s only possible if you have either the acquiescence of the state, which is the state looking the other way, or you have the support of the state, or the state is instructing you to carry out these abductions,” he said. Kenya’s National Police Service said in a statement this week that it was committed to “ensuring that these matters are thoroughly investigated to their logical conclusions” after criticism that its officers had made no attempt to probe the disappearances. Many of those abducted report being picked up by hooded men with guns and handcuffs. At a protest by Kenyan women in Nairobi on Monday, the same day that the five people were released, a police pickup truck drove around the city with men in balaclavas carrying guns and tear gas canisters, despite an August court order requiring police officers to be in uniform and have a nametag or service number while on duty. It’s one of many reasons why human rights groups, activists, some politicians, and regular Kenyans say the abductions have the government’s stamp of approval. Meanwhile, one of the recently returned men is struggling to come to terms with the ordeal, with his family telling CNN that he is severely traumatized. Peter Muteti Njeru, 22, was dragged into a car on December 21 while he was buying breakfast outside his apartment in Uthiru, a suburb near Nairobi, CCTV footage shows. Prior to his abduction, Muteti had posted an AI-generated image of Ruto in a casket to social media, an image some found offensive. Muteti’s cousin Ansity Kendi Christine told CNN that handcuff marks and cuts on Njeru’s arms indicate violence in detention. She said that Muteti was trying to protect himself during beatings while he was still handcuffed. Since his return, Muteti has been in “panic mode, confused and not sleeping well,” Kendi said, noting that he has been staying mostly inside since his return. “He’s opening up bit by bit, but we’ve got a long way to go. He’s a far cry from the 22-year-old who works in an office, has a girlfriend, makes his own meals and babysits my kids,” she said. Muteti’s family fears that he was punished more severely than other abductees to make an example out of him. He has not returned to social media and told his family that he was given a serious warning by his captors against speaking to the media, she added. Billy Mwangi, 24, is also keeping a low profile since his release. Mwangi disappeared from his barbershop’s doorstep the day after a now suspended X account belonging to him posted a doctored photo of Ruto in a casket, appearing to resurrect.  After 15 days of captivity, he returned to his parents in eastern Embu this week. Speaking to reporters, he said that he wasn’t ready to talk about the disappearance “because I’m still not fine mentally.” Flanked by his parents, who held him close, he said: “I thank God I’m alive.”"
Attack on Chad’s presidential palace leaves 19 dead,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/africa/chads-presidential-palace-attacked-intl/index.html,"An attack on Chad’s presidential palace left 18 assailants dead and six in custody, with one soldier killed and three wounded, state media reported Thursday. The attack on Wednesday night occurred while Chadian President Mahamat Deby Itno was inside the palace, but authorities said the situation was quickly brought under control. “The situation is completely under control. There is no fear,” Foreign Affairs Minister Abderaman Koulamallah said while surrounded by soldiers in a live Facebook broadcast filmed inside what appeared to be a quiet presidential palace late Wednesday. In an interview with state TV, Koulamallah praised the vigilance of the palace guards, describing the attackers as disorganized and intoxicated by alcohol and drugs. When asked if the attack was terrorism, he said it was probably not, as the attackers were local youths from the capital, N’Djamena. The attack occurred the same day as a visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who congratulated Deby Itno on reestablishing constitutional order. In the immediate aftermath, rumors spread online that the attack was the work of Islamic militant group Boko Haram. Boko Haram, which launched an insurgency more than a decade ago against Western education, seeks to establish Islamic law in Nigeria’s northeast. The insurgency has spread to neighboring West African countries including Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Chad, a country of nearly 18 million people, has been reeling from political turmoil before and after a controversial presidential election that resulted in Deby Itno’s victory. He had led the country as interim president during the period of military rule that followed the death of his father in 2021."
Venezuela accuses opposition of coordinating attacks on diplomatic facilities in 5 countries,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/americas/venezuela-attacks-diplomatic-facilities-intl-latam/index.html,"Venezuela’s foreign minister on Monday accused opponents of President Nicolás Maduro as being linked to damages at the country’s diplomatic facilities in five nations. Foreign Minister Yvan Gil in a statement said the vandalism was coordinated by grassroots groups known as “comanditos” – meaning small commandos – but he did not offer any evidence to back up the accusation, which comes three days after Maduro was sworn in to a third six-year term, despite credible evidence of his election defeat. Gil said he has asked the authorities in Portugal, Germany, Spain, Colombia and Costa Rica to expedite their investigations “to find those responsible and to ensure the integrity of our facilities.” He did not say when exactly the diplomatic facilities were vandalized. The main opposition coalition did not immediately respond to the minister’s accusations. Law enforcement authorities in Lisbon, Portugal, are investigating a weekend attack with a small incendiary device that caused some minor damage on the façade of Venezuela’s consulate in that city. Portugal’s Foreign Ministry in a statement Sunday called it and “intolerable act” and said it was reinforcing security in the area. Portugal has a strong immigrant community in Venezuela, the second largest following Brazil. According to official data by the diplomatic mission in the country, at least around 200,000 Portuguese nationals are registered in the country – a figure that does not include the descendants already born in Venezuela. Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry on Monday released images of the alleged vandalism that Gil announced. One shows hanging from a building a Venezuelan flag spray-painted with the word “Edmundo,” which is the first name of the opposition candidate recognized by several governments as the legitimate winner of Venezuela’s July presidential election. Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the election winner hours after polls closed. But unlike in previous contests, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts to back the announced result. The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online – showing its candidate, Edmundo González, had won by a more than a two-to-one margin. UN experts and the US-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro’s government to observe the election, said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate. The comanditos groups were formed by supporters of the main opposition coalition to encourage voter participation and organize other efforts for the July presidential election."
Venezuela’s Maduro starts another disputed term in office more isolated than ever,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/americas/nicolas-maduro-venezuela-new-term-analysis-intl/index.html,"Venezuelans once again watched as Nicolás Maduro was sworn into office on Friday, donning the executive sash and declaring himself president despite irregularities and questions around his election. He repeated his attacks against the United States and any foreign leaders who did not recognize his return to power and vowed to squash all of those who oppose him. “I come from the people. The power I represent belongs to the people and I owe it to the people,” Maduro told allies and supporters in his inauguration speech. For many Venezuelans, there will have been a sense of déjà vu as Maduro assumed his third six-year term in office following the contested July 28 election. The country’s National Electoral Council, the body responsible for supervising and certifying the vote, which is stacked with some of his closest loyalists, had declared Maduro the winner without providing detailed evidence or data to support his victory. But the opposition disputed the claim, releasing tens of thousands of voting tallies from around the country claiming that their candidate, Edmundo González, had actually won with 67% against Maduro’s 30%. The tallies were found to be legitimate by independent observers, such as the Carter Center and the Colombian Electoral Mission, as well as CNN’s own analysis. Several nations, including the United States, have since recognized González as Venezuela’s rightful president-elect and have issued new sanctions against Maduro and some of the country’s electoral authorities. Fellow opposition leader Maria Corina Machado accused Maduro of a coup d’état in a video posted to social media after he was sworn in for the third time. She said that with his inauguration “they decided to cross the red line” and “they stomp on our constitution.” “Today, Maduro did not put the presidential band on his chest, he put it on his ankle like a shackle that would tighten more every day,” she added. This is not the first time a Maduro victory has been called into question. In fact, every presidential vote in which he’s been a candidate, dating back to when he first took office nearly 12 years ago, has been disputed. Maduro first became president following the death of his predecessor and mentor Hugo Chavez in March 2013. The larger-than-life populist strongman – who had enshrined himself in power for nearly 15 years as the anti-establishment leader and transformed the country under his socialist-leaning Bolivarian Revolution – had hand-picked Maduro as his successor. Despite the endorsement, Maduro struggled in the polls and only beat his then-challenger Henrique Capriles by a razor-thin margin of 1.49%. It was considered at the time as one of the closest ballots in decades and the opposition claimed irregularities and fraud in the vote. Capriles, who had run against Chavez six months earlier and lost by 12%, called for an audit with the National Electoral Council and appealed the results with the Supreme Court. Both bodies were stacked with Chavez and Maduro supporters and the opposition’s claims were discredited. By the time Maduro’s second presidential election was scheduled to take place, Venezuela had fallen into a deep economic and political crisis. The once oil-rich country was suffering from hyperinflation and widespread economic woes. There were massive food shortages, rampant crime and millions of people had fled the country in fear and desperation. Many opposition leaders, including Capriles, were banned from running for political office with some arrested or forced into exile due to trumped-up accusations and charges. Maduro was reelected to his second term in May 2018, in what the opposition and many foreign leaders called a sham election due to the low voter turnout and an opposition boycott following the bans against its candidates. Only 46% of the country’s population participated in the vote, the National Electoral Council said at the time, and Maduro was sworn into office in January 2019. Massive protests broke out in the streets of the capital Caracas and throughout the country, questioning his legitimacy and calling for him to step down. This was not the first time the country had seen protests, but they were heavily repressed by the Maduro-supporting National Guard, police forces and militia groups and led to several deaths, injuries and arrests. As Maduro takes office for the third time, he finds himself more isolated than ever. His inauguration lacked the usual pomp and pageantry that normally surrounds the event. Cuba and Nicaragua were the only two countries with their presidents in attendance. Meanwhile, the ceremony itself was markedly lowkey in comparison to previous events, held in a small room of the National Assembly rather than the building’s main hall. Protesters also returned to the streets of Venezuela and the country’s growing diaspora staged marches in Ecuador, Spain and Mexico, among other locations. Biden administration officials met earlier this week in Washington DC with González, who was recognized by the US as Venezuela’s rightful president-elect. González, who has been living in exile after being accused of terrorism by the Maduro government, had vowed to return to the country to challenge the inauguration but said the “conditions for his entry” were not met. He posted a video message to his social media accounts from the Dominican Republic, in which he also accused Maduro of staging a coup. “Maduro has violated the Constitution, and the sovereign will of Venezuelans expressed on July 28,” González said. “He carried out a coup d’état and crowned himself a dictator.” US President-elect Donald Trump issued a harsh warning against Maduro following reports that Machado had been briefly kidnapped following a protest. The Maduro government denied any involvement. Shortly after the inauguration, the US announced a $25 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Maduro and his closest officials, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. Washington also announced an 18-month extension of Temporary Protected Status for eligible Venezuelan nationals, which could benefit some 600,000 people living in the US. Nearly 8 million Venezuelans have left the country over the last decade, the second largest displacement in the world, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Venezuelans are bracing for yet another wave of repression following Maduro’s return. One Latin American diplomat told CNN earlier this week that the atmosphere in the country was “fearful.” Maduro and his allies are “showing they are not going to tolerate any dissent, and people are scared,” said the diplomat, who spoke anonymously to avoid possible repercussions. The strongman leader may have succeeded in reclaiming Venezuela’s highest office but with so many – both at home and abroad – still questioning if he stole the election, he could find himself struggling for allies on the world stage."
Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro sworn in for third presidential term as opposition decries ‘coup’,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/americas/venezuelas-nicolas-maduro-sworn-in-intl/index.html,"Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro has been sworn in for a third presidential term in what the country’s opposition movement has decried as “coup d’etat,” culminating more than five months of dispute over last summer’s contested election. The ceremony took place on Friday in a small room of the National Assembly, a marked difference from previous ceremonies held in the building’s main hall. Maduro was sworn in by National Assembly leader Jorge Rodríguez, who placed the presidential sash on him, prompting thunderous applause from those in attendance. “We’ve achieved what we knew we would achieve,” Maduro said during his first speech after bein﻿g sworn in. “The power given to me was not given by a foreign government, a foreign president or a gringo government,” Maduro said at the event, which saw Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and Cuba’s Miguel Diaz-Canel in attendance. “No one in this world can impose a president in Venezuela.” China and Russia also sent representatives, with Russia’s State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin seen arriving late on a state media broadcast after the ceremony began ahead of schedule. Maduro was proclaimed winner of the country’s presidential election on July 28, by electoral authorities under the tight control of the ruling Socialist Party. But Venezuela’s opposition has published thousands of voting tallies claiming that their candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, had actually won the vote with 67% against Maduro’s 30%. Independent observers such as the Carter Center and the Colombian Electoral Mission, as well as CNN’s own analysis, have found the opposition tallies to be legitimate. And several nations, including the United States, have since recognized Gonzalez as Venezuela’s rightful president-elect. And in a speech Friday afternoon, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado remained defiant, accusing Maduro’s government of trampling on Venezuela’s constitution. Going forward, “the pressure will increase even more until Maduro understands that this is over,” she pledged. Maduro “violates the constitution, also flanked by the dictators of Cuba and Nicaragua, this says it all,” she added. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby accused Maduro of “a complete disregard for democratic norms,” describing Friday’s swearing-in as “an illegitimate inauguration” in remarks to reporters. González, who has been in exile since September with a bounty on his head by Venezuelan authorities, had pledged to return to Caracas this week in a potential last challenge to Maduro’s inauguration. But his planned return on Friday was called off due to security concerns, Paraguayan President Santiago Peña told CNN’s Isa Soares. “I continue to work on the conditions for my entry into Venezuela and assume, as mandated by the Constitution and ordered by the people, the presidency of the republic and as commander in chief of the national armed forces,” González said in a statement Friday. González’s last known location on Friday was the Dominican Republic, where he had recently met with regional leaders. Shortly after the inauguration, the US announced an 18-month extension of Temporary Protected Status for eligible Venezuelan nationals, and new rewards for information leading to the arrest of Maduro and his closest officials, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. The rewards for Maduro and for Cabello — now amounting to $25 million each — are the maximum rewards allowed under the State Department’s narcotics reward program, an official said. The US also announced new visa restrictions for Maduro-aligned officials whom the administration says are responsible for undermining Venezuela’s electoral process, and individual sanctions on eight Maduro-aligned officials overseeing economic and security agencies in Venezuela, including a state-owned oil company and Maduro’s transportation minister. On a call previewing the announcement, the official told reporters that Maduro “stands mostly alone at this juncture, with few friends in the region and the world,” noting statements from countries throughout the region and across the globe “since July 28th to call on Maduro to respect democratic norms.” Meanwhile, the United Kingdom on Friday sanctioned 15 people associated with Maduro and what it called his “contested regime,” including leaders from Venezuela’s Armed Forces and members of the Supreme Justice Tribunal. The European Union also issued sanctions against 15 people affiliated with Maduro, who have been accused of “undermining democracy, rule of law or human rights in Venezuela.” And Canada sanctioned 14 current and former senior officials who it said engaged in activities that “supported human rights violations” in the country. The G7 also criticized the inauguration, saying it lacked democratic legitimacy. “We reject Maduro’s continued and repressive grasp at power at the expense of the Venezuelan people,” a statement from the group read. Maduro did not name any of Venezuela’s opposition leaders in his speech, but referred to the movement currently led by Machado and Gonzalez as “Guaidó 2.0” — a reference to Juan Guaidó, who in 2019 proclaimed himself interim president of Venezuela and was recognized by 50 countries, including the US. “A Guaidó 2.0 talks to the people in the streets, a new Guaidó, and comes with the same baggage, we saw it, we saw their plans, we saw them yesterday,” Maduro said, apparently referring to an opposition rally attended by Machado on Thursday. Guaidó also condemned the inauguration, writing on X that “the president of Venezuela is Edmundo González Urrutia.” “Maduro only confirms his usurpation and the coup d’état they carried out on July 28,” Guaidó added. Venezuelan opposition coalition Plataforma de la Unidad Democrática echoed Guaidó’s remarks, saying, “a new phase begins today in this fight for the freedom of Venezuela throughout the national territory and in all sectors that form our nation.” And Human Rights Watch Americas director Juanita Goebertus criticized Maduro’s swearing-in as “the culmination of an election that blatantly disregarded the people’s will and consolidates a dictatorship only sustained by brutal repression.” Ahead of the inauguration, Venezuela closed its land border and suspended flights to Colombia – a move that Freddie Bernal, the governor of the Venezuelan border state of Tachira, claimed was in reaction to a “international conspiracy” against Venezuela, in an Instagram post. He did not provide proof for his claim. The border closure came just hours after Colombia broke its silence on the issue and announced it would not recognize the results of last summer’s elections, stating they were not free. Protests erupted in Caracas and other Venezuelan cities ahead of the inauguration, with Machado emerging from hiding to speak at one event on Thursday. Machado was later “violently intercepted” at the event, according to her team, which said that “during the period of her kidnapping she was forced to record several videos and was later released.” The Venezuelan government has denied detaining Machado. Machado said that despite attempts to quell dissent, Venezuelans had “defeated fear” with Thursday’s rallies. “Yesterday, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans went to the streets with civility, courage and profound love,” Machado said in her video message Friday. This is a developing story and will be updated."
Brazil gives Meta 72 hours to explain changes to fact-checking program,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/americas/brazil-meta-fact-checking-program-intl/index.html,"Brazil’s government will give Meta until Monday to explain the changes to its fact-checking program, Solicitor General Jorge Messias said on Friday. The move comes after the social media company scrapped its US fact-checking program and reduced curbs on discussions around topics such as immigration and gender identity. It is not immediately clear exactly what will happen after the deadline expires. “I’d like to express the Brazilian government’s enormous concern about the policy adopted by the Meta company, which is like an airport windsock, changing its position all the time according to the winds,” Messias, the government’s top lawyer, told reporters in Brasilia. “Brazilian society will not be at the mercy of this kind of policy,” Messias added. On Thursday, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said the changes were “extremely serious” and announced he had called a meeting to discuss the topic. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In announcing the move on Tuesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg cited “too many mistakes and too much censorship.” A spokesperson said on Tuesday that, for now, Meta was planning the changes only for the US market. Reuters, which was a Meta partner on its US fact-checking program, has declined to comment."
Tsunami advisory lifted after 6.9 magnitude earthquake rattles southwest Japan,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/asia/tsunami-advisory-earthquake-southwestern-japan-intl/index.html,"Japan’s Meteorological Agency withdrew a tsunami advisory after a 6.9 magnitude earthquake occurred off the coast of southwest Japan. The quake struck shortly after 9:19 p.m. local time (7:19 a.m. ET), the agency said, triggering an advisory for Miyazaki prefecture, in the island of Kyushu, as well as Japan’s southern Kochi prefecture. An initial tsunami wave approximately 1 meter (3.2 feet) high made landfall within 30 minutes of the earthquake, the Associated Press reported, citing Japanese public broadcaster NHK TV. Authorities lifted the tsunami advisory late Monday evening but still urged locals to stay away from the sea and near the coast – warning that second and third waves may be higher than the first. Cliff collapses and falling rocks could still pose a threat to residents should earthquakes of the same magnitude hit the area, according to weather officials. “An earthquake could occur at any time, and it is important to ensure that preparations for earthquakes are implemented on a daily basis,” officials said in a press conference. Most of Japan is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire – a zone of intense seismic and volcanic activity – making it vulnerable to frequent earthquakes. Last summer, the Japanese weather agency issued a stark megathrust earthquake alert following tremors in parts of western Japan originating from the Hyuga-nada Sea – and where Monday’s earthquake originated. In 2011, the deadliest quake and subsequent tsunami in recent Japanese history struck northwest of the capital Tokyo and killed at least 20,000 people. The 9.1 magnitude Tohoku earthquake spiraled into a fierce tsunami and nuclear disaster – obliterating homes, swamping cities and leaving survivors psychologically scarred.

"‘Black boxes’ from crashed South Korean plane stopped recording about four minutes before disaster, officials say",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/asia/south-korean-airline-black-boxes-stopped-recording-intl-hnk/index.html,"Flight recorders from the passenger jet that crashed in South Korea last month, killing more than 170 people, stopped working minutes before the plane belly-landed and exploded on the runway, investigators said Saturday. Officials probing the country’s deadliest aviation accident in almost three decades had hoped information from the so-called black boxes would shed light on why Jeju Air flight 7C 2216 from Bangkok belly-landed at Muan International Airport on December 29, erupting into a fireball. The disaster killed 179 passengers and crew members. Two people survived. But South Korea’s transport ministry said Saturday that both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) from the Boeing 737-800 had stopped working about four minutes before the crash. In a statement, the ministry said it was unclear why the devices stopped recording, adding that it will work to determine the cause. “CVR and FDR data are important data for accident investigations, but accident investigations are conducted through investigation and analysis of various data, so we plan to do our best to accurately identify the cause of the accident,” the ministry said. The cockpit voice recorder was first analyzed locally and later sent to the United States for cross-checking, the ministry said. The flight data recorder, which was damaged and missing a connector, was sent to the National Transportation Safety Board in the US last week for analysis, after South Korean authorities concluded they could not extract data from the device, due to the damage. CNN has contacted the NTSB for comment. The crash was the country’s deadliest since 1997, when a Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 crashed in the Guam jungle, with the loss of 228 lives. It is not yet clear what caused it, with the investigation expected to take months. Footage of the crash showed that neither the back nor front landing gear was visible at the time of the crash-landing. Prior to the emergency landing, the pilot made a mayday call and used the terms “bird strike” and “go-around,” according to officials, who also said the control tower had warned the pilot of birds in the area. Another point of contention has been the concrete embankment that the plane hit upon landing. Many airports don’t have similar structures so close to runways, according to aviation experts. South Korean police last week also raided Jeju Air’s office in Seoul and the operator of Muan International Airport as part of their investigation, Reuters reported."
Philippines’ Black Nazarene procession draws hundreds of thousands of devotees,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/asia/philippines-black-nazarene-procession-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hundreds of thousands of barefoot devotees joined an annual procession in the Philippines of a centuries-old statue of Jesus Christ on Thursday in one of the world’s grandest displays of Catholic devotion and expressions of faith. Filipinos turned the streets of Manila to a sea of maroon and gold and swarmed the “Black Nazarene,” a life-sized image of Jesus Christ bearing down a cross, as devotees jostled for a chance to pull the thick rope towing the carriage across the Philippine capital. The procession’s organizers have estimated about 220,000 people attended mass before the procession, while 94,500 were in the march as of 8 a.m. (0000 GMT). That number is expected to swell as it moves along its 5.8 km (3.6 mile) route. Other devotees threw white towels at the image as marshals wiped them on its surface, believing that touching the statue would bless them and heal their illnesses. Nearly 80% of Filipinos identify as Roman Catholic, a key legacy of more than 300 years of Spanish colonization in the Philippine archipelago. The late Filipino priest and theologian Sabino Vengco said in 2019 the statue’s revered black color was due to the mesquite wood used in constructing the image, debunking a longstanding myth its blackened image was due to a fire that erupted on the ship that carried it to the Philippines from Mexico in the early 17th century. The procession, called the “traslacion,” or translation, commemorates the transfer of the Black Nazarene from a church inside the old Spanish colonial capital of Intramuros, in present-day Manila, to its current location in Quiapo church. Cardinal Jose Advincula, Manila’s archbishop, told devotees on Thursday to turn away from evil, greed and vices and follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. “Let us live up to his commandments, embrace his teachings and follow his example. It is better to follow the Beloved Lord,” Advincula said in his homily ahead of the procession."
"Airstrike on village in western Myanmar kills at least 40 people, groups say",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/asia/myanmar-village-army-airstrike-intl-hnk/index.html,"An airstrike by Myanmar’s army on a village under the control of an armed ethnic minority group killed about 40 people and injured at least 20 others, officials of the group and a local charity said Thursday. They said hundreds of houses burned in a fire triggered by the bombing. The attack occurred Wednesday in Kyauk Ni Maw village on Ramree island, an area controlled by the ethnic Arakan Army in western Rakhine state, they said. The military has not announced any attack in the area. The situation in the village could not be independently confirmed, with access to the internet and cellphone service in the area mostly cut off. Myanmar is wracked by violence that began when the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. After the army used lethal force to suppress peaceful demonstrations, many opponents of military rule took up arms and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict. Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told The Associated Press that a jet fighter bombed the village on Wednesday afternoon, killing 40 civilians and injuring more than 20 others. “All the dead were civilians. Among the dead and injured are women and children,” Khaing Thukha said. A fire started by the airstrike spread through the village, destroying more than 500 houses, Khaing Thukha added. It was unclear why the village was targeted. The leader of a local charity group and independent media also reported the airstrike and casualties. The military government has stepped up airstrikes over the past three years on armed pro-democracy groups collectively known as the People’s Defense Force and on armed ethnic minority groups that have been fighting for decades for greater autonomy. The two groups sometimes carry out joint operations against the army. Ramree – 340 kilometers (210 miles) northwest of Yangon, the country’s largest city – was captured by the Arakan Army in March last year. The Arakan Army is the well-trained and well-armed military wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority movement which seeks autonomy from Myanmar’s central government. It is also a member of an alliance of armed ethnic groups that recently gained strategic territory in the country’s northeast on the border with China. It began its offensive in Rakhine in November 2023 and has now gained control of a strategically important regional army headquarters and 14 of Rakhine’s 17 townships, leaving only the state’s capital, Sittwe, and two important townships near Ramree still in military government hands. A leader of the charity group, which has been assisting residents of the village, told AP on Thursday that at least 41 people were killed and 50 others were injured in the airstrike, which targeted the village’s market. The leader, who was away from the town at the time of the airstrike, spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns. He said he received the information from members of his group who were in the village and were facing a shortage of medicine to treat the injured people. Rakhine-based news outlets including Arakan Princess Media also reported the attack and posted photos online showing people putting out fires at their homes. Rakhine, formerly known as Arakan, was the site of a brutal army counterinsurgency operation in 2017 that drove about 740,000 minority Rohingya Muslims to seek safety across the border in Bangladesh."
Mysterious ball-shaped debris prompts closure of nine Sydney beaches,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/travel/sydney-beaches-closed-mysterious-debris-intl-hnk/index.html,"Nine beaches in Sydney, including well-known Manly beach, were closed to bathers on Tuesday after small white and grey balls of debris washed up on the shores at the height of the summer holiday season. Northern Beaches Council said it was working on safely removing the matter. Most of the samples of the ball-shaped debris were the size of marbles, with some larger, it said in a statement. Sydney’s ocean beaches, famed for golden sand and clean water, draw tourists from around the globe. Beachgoers were advised to avoid Manly, Dee Why, Long Reef, Queenscliff, Freshwater, North and South Curl Curl, North Steyne and North Narrabeen beaches until further notice and keep away from the material while the clean-up and investigations continued. Authorities said they were working closely with the state’s environmental agency to collect samples of the debris for testing. Last October, several beaches including the iconic Bondi east of downtown Sydney were shut after thousands of black balls appeared on the shores. An inquiry later found that those balls were formed from fatty acids, chemicals similar to those in cosmetics and cleaning products, as well as hair, food waste and other materials associated with wastewater."
"59 degrees Fahrenheit might not sound that chilly. In Thailand’s capital, it’s a shock to the system",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/travel/thailand-bangkok-cold-weather-intl-hnk/index.html,"Tropical beaches, cold drinks by the pool and extreme heat are some of the things one might associate with Thailand. Yet, a rare recent cold snap has seen residents of the kingdom’s capital throwing on extra layers and enjoying the cool winter breeze. Temperatures in Bangkok fell as low as 59.3 degrees Fahrenheit (15.2 degrees Celsius) on Monday, the lowest the capital has seen in years, as the country’s weather agency warned cool conditions could persist through mid-February. On bustling Silom Road in downtown Bangkok, locals bundled up in sweaters and hoodies, some even thrusting their hands in their pockets to keep warm. “This year is different, I can’t remember the last time Bangkok was this cold,” Ms. Kai, a 63-year-old drinks vendor, told CNN. “When I was kid, it was much colder, and it stayed for a long time.” Bangkok typically sees temperatures between 73 and 91 degrees Fahrenheit (23 to 33 degrees Celsius) during January, according to the Tourism Authority of Thailand – one reason why it’s a paradise for many tourists looking to escape winter in the northern hemisphere. Thailand’s northern mountainous region, known as the Thai highlands, often experiences cooler temperatures than the capital, dipping to an average low of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) near the city of Chiang Mai in January. However, both Bangkok and Thailand’s north have seen temperatures plummet to unusual lows this week, because of a high-pressure swing from China, the Thai Meteorological Department said. Monday’s temperature was the coldest in Bangkok since 2017, according to the meteorological department. The city’s lowest recorded temperature was around 49 degrees Fahrenheit (9.9 degrees Celsius) on January 12, 1955, according to data from the meteorological department. The agency said that while temperatures are expected to warm from this weekend, the cooler weather could persist across the country until at least mid-February. While some residents hope the unusually cool temperatures will be good for business, others say they are enjoying the welcome change from Bangkok’s usual heat. “I hope this is good for my business so people would enjoy walking on Bangkok’s streets more,” said Kai, the vendor. “Normally, [the] traffic of people would die down very quickly after lunchtime and in the afternoon. One of the reasons [was] because of the heat.” Office worker Thanawat Yooyen, 28, told CNN she was enjoying “these brief moments” of winter. “[It’s] better than nothing,” she said. One X user wrote on the social media platform, “Mother Elsa is bringing the cold so that people in Bangkok are getting chilly,” referring to the character in Disney’s animated film “Frozen.” Another X user wrote, “So cold in Bangkok this morning I’m in need of my warm jacket. I guess most Thais will be dusting off their puffer coats.” Travelers and residents are advised to take precautions to stay warm and to be cautious of fire hazards caused by dry and windy winter conditions.

One of the world’s greatest religious spectacles is underway and the numbers are staggering,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/travel/india-maha-kumbh-mela-2025-intl-hnk/index.html,"Millions of Hindu devotees are bathing in sacred waters as the world’s biggest religious gathering begins in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Over the next six weeks, a staggering 400 million people are expected to attend the Maha Kumbh Mela, or the festival of the Sacred Pitcher, on the riverbanks in the city of Prayagraj. Every 12 years the festival carries the prefix “Maha,” which means great, as it’s the largest gathering of the Kumbh Mela that’s held every three years in one of four cities. In Prayagraj, followers will bathe in the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of three holy rivers – the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati – to purify their sins and take another step closer to “spiritual liberation.” The Kumbh draws upon Hindu mythology and the legend of demons and gods fighting over a pitcher containing the elixir of immortality. During the fight, four drops from the pitcher fell on Earth, in Prayagraj, Nashik, Haridwar and Ujjain, which host the festival in rotation. The gathering is particularly well-known for attracting large crowds of Hindu holy men, known as sadhus, who travel from across the country. Sadhus are ascetics who have renounced worldly goods and life and are famous for their dreadlocks, ash covered bodies as well as their bright – and at times minimal – clothing. On Tuesday morning, scores of naked sadhus bathed in the waters as part of a key moment at the start of the festival. Indian Prime Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Narendra Modi has invited people from all over the world to attend the festival, recognized by UNESCO in 2017 as an “intangible cultural heritage of humanity.” Authorities are promoting the event not just as a religious gathering but a cultural spectacle that in the past has attracted both Bollywood and Hollywood stars. On Sunday, Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh’s saffron-clad priest turned chief minister known for his provocative rhetoric against Muslims, said millions of people had already taken a “dip in the sacred waters of the Sangam.” Formerly known as Allahabad, Prayagraj was renamed by Adityanath in 2018, a decision that was said to recognize the city’s identity as a spiritual destination for Hindu pilgrims. Shedding the name Allahabad, given to the city by Mughal emperor Akbar, was a symbolic move in keeping with Modi’s ambitions to transform India from a secular, pluralistic state into a nation of and for the Hindu faith. This year’s festival has taken years of planning and millions of dollars to build facilities for the influx of visitors to Prayagraj, a city normally home to 6 million people. Around 160,000 tents, 150,000 toilets and a 776-mile (1,249-kilometer) drinking water pipeline have been installed at a temporary tent city covering 4,000 hectares, roughly the size of 7,500 football fields. In 2013, dozens of people were killed and injured in a crowd crush at a railway station as pilgrims gathered in the city. Such deadly incidents at religious gatherings in India are not uncommon, often highlighting a lack of adequate crowd control and safety measures. This year, officials say extra safety measures have been put in place in Prayagraj to protect visitors, including a security ring with checkpoints around the city staffed by more than 1,000 police officers. Over 2,700 security cameras powered by artificial intelligence will be positioned around the city, monitored by hundreds of experts at key locations, according to the central government. Aerial drones will provide surveillance from above and for the first time, underwater drones capable of diving up to 100 meters will be activated to provide round-the-clock cover, the government added. Vast numbers of pilgrims are expected to travel to the region by train, so authorities have added 3,000 special trains and 13,100 train services. Fourteen new flyovers and underpasses, 11 new road corridors, 7,000 buses, 550 shuttle buses, seven new bus stops, and 30 pontoon bridges have also been added to improve connectivity, according to the Uttar Pradesh state government. The festival ends on February 26."
Italy’s hot spots are being overwhelmed with tourists. These hidden places offer an escape without the crowds,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/beautiful-places-italy-no-tourists/index.html,"Want to visit Italy but have been put off by the idea of peak season tourists crowds surging through Rome, Florence and Venice? Can’t afford the ever-increasing prices of hot spots such as Capri or Tuscany? Don’t worry. There’s far more to Italy than the places that usually feature on travel itineraries. Explore a little farther, and there are scores of extraordinary places where tourists are a rare sight. They might require a little extra effort to reach, but these secret spots where traditions and old lifestyles survive offer a chance to experience the authentic soul of Italy. Here are some of the best: To get here, you need to get lost in the isolated area of Ciociaria, a wild terrain once known for banditry. It straddles the regions of Lazio and Campania, just south of Rome. Posta Fibreno is a tiny, isolated hamlet, in the province of Frosinone, which feels magically frozen in time. Surrounded by fields of grazing sheep, it consists of just a few farmhouses, a bar and a fish tavern. The main highlight is its dreamy lake dotted with water lilies, a beautiful setting that seems imported from somewhere far more exotic than this lost corner of Italy. Ancient liana trees dangle their branches into the sparkling green water as friendly geese and swans drift by. There are paddle boats and dinghies for rental to explore the lake, and soft grass to lie down on for a waterfront picnic. It’s a great place to mingle with locals, relaxing and strolling along the lake shores. The first thing that greets visitors in this Alpine village that straddles Italy’s border with Austria is the sweet scent of warm strudel and orange punch, sold at the stands of an open-air market of cured meats and wool-lined clogs. Located in Trentino Alto Adige (or Sud Tiröl for German speakers, who call the village Innichen), San Candido barely feels like Italy, something that’s compounded by the fact hardly anyone here speaks Italian. This skiing haven was once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it was annexed by dictator Benito Mussolini, but locals are still proud of their Teutonic origins. Narrow cobbled streets connect frescoed, pastel-color cottages with painted images of giants, warriors, forest monsters, snow queens and dwarves who, according to local lore, sprayed the peaks of the surrounding Dolomites with pink crystals. Millennia ago, San Candido’s location was once underwater in a tropical ocean, and its skiing slopes are a former coral reef. The local museum showcases dinosaur fossils unearthed on the nearby glaciers. There’s been a settlement at what is now one of the Lazio region’s best-kept secrets since prehistoric times. Modern-day Romans know about Calcata, escaping their city for detox day trips when it all gets a bit too much. The scenery is spellbinding. This tiny hamlet is perched precariously over a precipice — first-time visitors could be forgiven for thinking it’s about to slide down the rust-colored cliffs it sits on, plunging into a deep chasm covered with woods. Below is a pristine river where pagan tribes once carried out human sacrifices. One narrow path leads to a stone arched entrance. Here, ancient cave dwellings cut out from the rock are barely distinguishable from naturally formed features. The hamlet, where a hippie community has flourished over the years, is a car-free labyrinth of moss-covered cobbled alleyways, tunnels and wall openings that overlook the thick jungle-like canyon. Located along the coast between Rome and Naples, Cicero rises up into the sky and stretches out into the Tyrrhenian Sea. The alluring peak has been worshiped as a sacred promontory since the dawn of time. It’s said our cave-dwelling ancestors made human sacrifices here, and even carried out acts of cannibalism. A few skulls have been unearthed in its sea grottoes. Don’t let that put you off. Mount Circeo is a protected natural reserve that’s great for trekking, canoeing and snorkeling. It’s surrounded by pristine beaches and lakes as well as pastureland tended by grazing buffalo, watermelon fields and kiwi plantations, Ancient Romans loved to come here to detox in lavish villas and thermal baths. It’s claimed that, in Homer’s classical poem “The Odyssey,” it’s where sorceress Circe bewitched Odysseus, turning his men into pigs. Locals claim that the mount has the shape of a sleeping woman. Today, locals still like to joke that thick woodland here is inhabited by dozens of wild boars. Italy is dotted with some 20,000 ghost towns but Pentedattilo is probably one of the most fascinating. Located in deep rural Calabria (the toe of Italy’s boot), it can be easily explored on foot. It rises on the slopes of rocky Mount Calvario, shaped like a giant hand with five fat fingers pointing to the sky (In Greek Pentedattilo means “five fingers”). Once home to a bustling community, the village was struck by a series of earthquakes leading to its total abandonment in the 1970s when locals fled in search of a better life, leaving their old stone dwellings behind. Many families simply moved further down the hill, where a new town was built. That means, unlike most other Italian ghost towns, Pentedattilo isn’t completely dead. In recent times there’s been a revival led by local youth groups and the opening of artisan boutiques and a small tavern. A series of art festivals also help bring the place back from the grave in summer. A handful of die-hard residents, mostly artists and yoga enthusiasts — as well as plenty of cats — now live in the abandoned district. Known as a “pearl of the Adriatic,” this elegant little seaside village is a great, and cheaper, alternative to the eye-wateringly expensive island of Capri — plus it boasts a pair of faraglioni (sea stacks), just like Capri. Built right on the top of the pristine Conero sea promontory in east-central Italy’s lesser-known Marche region, it’s an ideal, quiet vacation spot for beach-lovers who want to get away from sweaty sunbathers and screaming kids. Sirolo has a glorious past. Its medieval district, totally car-free, is a maze of circular narrow alleyways that connect aristocratic palazzos to an overhanging castle, tower and walled walkway. The tiny central piazza is considered one of the most romantic spots of the entire Conero Riviera, offering spectacular panoramic sunsets. At Due Sorelle (the “two sisters”), a stunning pebble beach is enclosed by the two sea stacks and can only be reached by sea using canoes or the help of local fishers. Italy’s southern city of Matera, which took a starring role in Mel Gibson’s “The Passion of the Christ,” has gained fame in recent years on account of its incredible cityscape of cave homes dug out from steep-sided cliffs. Nearby Gravina is a hundred times more fascinating. Locals know that the key adrenaline action scenes in the latest James Bond movie was shot here, not in Matera where it was supposedly set. Located in Puglia, Gravina is carved out from the flanks of a huge canyon, with dwellings made from layers of caves and cracks formed across millennia by the erosion of prehistoric limestone. Cavemen once inhabited these grottoes, which have now turned into dwellings. Gravina’s old district is a labyrinth of rock churches and sanctuaries. The most breathtaking highlight is the pedestrian Madonna della Stella aqueduct-bridge, an ancient arched structure 90 meters long and 37 meters high. This is where James Bond jumps off a bridge in the movie “No Time to Die.” The bridge offers great views of the town and the below canyon. An unusual must-see is La Gnostre, a narrow circular spiral-like alley without an exit where locals hang out at night. Underground treasures can be explored on guided tours across a network of tunnels, cavities, old granaries, olive presses, cellars and wells. Gravina hosts one of Europe’s oldest events, the Saint George’s Fair held each April since 1294, with musical performances and gourmet products. Visitors flocking to northern Italy’s huge Lake Garda often miss this hidden beauty spot, far from the noisy destinations loved by VIPs. In Tenno, silence rules. Built during the middle ages, Tenno’s overhanging castle boasts spectacular views of Garda and the surrounding Alps from a seldom-seen perspective. The village is in a cluster of stone houses and narrow cobblestone alleyways built at the feet of the majestic castle. A must-see is the nearby lesser-known Lake Tenno, known for its turquoise-purple waters. A long staircase leads to the grassy shores of the lake, ideal for a quick refreshing dip in summer or a winter picnic. From here, a 20-minute walk connects to the hamlet of Canale di Tenno, listed as one of the most beautiful villages in Italy. Being here is like stepping back in time. Locals call it “a portal into the past.” The fairy-tale, dreamy vibe is enhanced by painted old stone dwellings with balconies overlooking the alleyways. At Christmas there’s an artisan market, while in summer history fans enjoy the Rustico Medioevo festival, where medieval life is re-enacted."
Everyone is talking about Greenland. Here’s what it’s like to visit,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/what-its-like-visit-greenland/index.html,"A few weeks ago, Greenland was quietly getting on with winter, as the territory slid deeper into the darkness that envelops the world’s northerly reaches at this time of year. But President-elect Donald Trump’s musings about America taking over this island of 56,000 largely Inuit people, halfway between New York and Moscow, has seen Greenland shaken from its frozen Arctic anonymity. Denmark, for whom Greenland is an autonomous crown dependency, has protested it’s not for sale. Officials in Greenland, meanwhile, have sought to assert the territory’s right to independence. The conversation intensified after January 7 when Donald Trump Jr. paid a fleeting visit. Had Trump Jr. stayed longer than for a photo-opportunity he would’ve discovered a ruggedly pristine wildernesses steeped in rich Indigenous culture. An inhospitable icecap several miles deep covers 80% of Greenland, forcing the Inuit to dwell along the shorelines in brightly painted communities. Here, they spend brutally cold winters hunting seals on ice under the northern lights in near perpetual darkness. Although these days, they can also rely on community stores. The problem for travelers over the years has been getting to Greenland via time-consuming indirect flights. That’s changing. Late in 2024, the capital Nuuk opened a long-delayed international airport. From June 2025, United Airlines will be operating a twice-weekly direct service from Newark to Nuuk. Two further international airports are due to open by 2026 — Qaqortoq in South Greenland and more significantly in Ilulissat, the island’s only real tourism hotspot. Located on the west coast, Ilulissat is a pretty halibut- and prawn-fishing port on a dark rock bay where visitors can sit in pubs sipping craft beers chill-filtered by 100,000-year-old glacial ice. It’s a place to be awed by the UNESCO World Heritage Icefjord where Manhattan skyscraper-sized icebergs disgorge from Greenland’s icecap to float like ghostly ships in the surrounding Disko Bay. Small boats take visitors out to sail closely among the bay’s magnificent iceberg flotilla. But not too close. “I was on my boat once and saw one of these icebergs split in two. The pieces fell backwards into the sea and created a giant wave,” said David Karlsen, skipper of the pleasure-boat, Katak. “…I didn’t hang around.” Disko Bay’s other giants are whales. From June to September breaching humpback whales join the likes of fin and minke whales feasting on plankton. Whale-watching is excellent all around Greenland’s craggy coastline. Whales are eaten here. Visitors shouldn’t be surprised to encounter the traditional Greenlandic delicacy of mattak — whale-skin and blubber that when tasted is akin to chewing on rubber. Inuit communities have quotas to not only hunt the likes of narwhals but also polar bears, musk-ox and caribou — which can also appear on menus. Ilulissat is also a hub for coastal sea cruises. Driving Greenland’s record 141,000 visitors in 2024 was a surge in cruise tourism. The west coast is especially popular with voyages, typically emanating from North America or Iceland. From Ilulissat, cruise ships hug the coastline heading south, calling at pretty little communities of green, blue, yellow and purple painted houses, and Qeqertarsuaq (Disko) Island, where flat-topped mountains are capped by glaciers. They also explore the striking blue waters of Eternity Fjord near Maniitsoq and South Greenland’s ancient hut sites of pre-Inuit paleo cultures and the remains of Viking longhouses dating back to their 10th-century arrival. A more organic way to see this coast is by the multi-day coastal ferry, the long-running Sarfaq Ittuk, of the Arctic Umiaq Line. It’s less corporate than the modern cruise ships and travelers get to meet Inuit commuters. Greenland is pricey. Lettuce in a local community store might cost $10, but this coastal voyage won’t break the bank. The hot ticket currently for exploring Greenland’s wilder side is to head to the east coast facing Europe. It’s raw and sees far fewer tourists, with a harshly dramatic coastline of fjords where icebergs drift south. There are no roads and the scattered population of just over 3,500 people inhabit a coastline roughly the distance from New York to Denver. A growing number of small expedition vessels probe this remote coast for its frosted scenery and wildlife. Increasingly popular is the world’s largest fjord system of Scoresby Sound with its sharp-fanged mountains and hanging valleys choked by glaciers. Sailing north is the prosaically named North East Greenland National Park, fabulous for spotting wildlife on the tundra. Travelers come to see polar bears which, during the northern hemisphere’s summer, move closer to land as the sea-ice melts. There are also musk oxen, great flocks of migrating geese, Arctic foxes and walrus. Some of these animals are fair game for the local communities. Perhaps Greenland’s most interesting cultural visit is to a village that will take longer to learn how to pronounce than actually walk around — Ittoqqortoormiit. Five hundred miles north of its neighboring settlement, the 345 locals are frozen in for nine months of the year. Ships sail in to meet them during the brief summer melt between June and August. Locked in by ice, they’ve retained traditional habits. “My parents hunt nearly all their food,” said Mette Barselajsen, who owns Ittoqqortoormiit’s only guesthouse. “They prefer the old ways, burying it in the ground to ferment and preserve it. Just one muskox can bring 440 pounds of meat.” For getting around during winter, the Inuit here nowadays prefer snowmobiles, although they still keep their sled dogs. During winter they’ll offer intrepid visitors, wrapped up warm against the deep-freeze temperatures, dog-sledding jaunts. These can last either an hour or be part of expeditions over several days, sometimes with the added experience of learning how to build an igloo. Sisimiut on the west coast and Tasilaq in the southeast are active winter centers for dog sledding. Winter’s most stellar attraction, though, is northern lights watching. With little urban light pollution, Greenland is a dark canvas for spectacular displays, and aurora borealis-watching vacations are becoming more popular. Staying outdoors, Greenland is developing a reputation among adventure enthusiasts: from long-distance skiing expeditions and heliskiing on the icecap to hiking the 100-mile-long Arctic Circle Trail from Kangerslussuaq, where firearms need to be carried for warning shots in case of polar bear encounters. Life is definitely changing here. The climate crisis is eating away at its icecap and Greenland may well end up as a pawn in a game of geopolitical chess. But for now, the bright glare of international attention should shine a favorable light on one of the wildest travel destinations on Earth. Travel writer Mark Stratton is an Arctic specialist who has traveled to Greenland six times and counting. He’s marveled at the aurora borealis, sailed to Disko Island, dog-sledded with the Inuit, and once got stuck in an icefloe."
"A brief history of sunglasses, from Ancient Rome to Hollywood",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/style/history-of-sunglasses-fashion-conversation/index.html,"Sunglasses, or dark glasses, have always guarded against strong sunlight, but is there more to “shades” than we think? The pupils of our eyes are delicate and react immediately to strong lights. Protecting them against light — even the brilliance reflected off snow — is important for everyone. Himalayan mountaineers wear goggles for this exact purpose. Protection is partly the function of sunglasses. But dark or colored lens glasses have become fashion accessories and personal signature items. Think of the vast and famous collector of sunglasses Elton John, with his pink lensed heart-shaped extravaganzas and many others. When did this interest in protecting the eyes begin, and at what point did dark glasses become a social statement as well as physical protection? The Roman Emperor Nero is reported as holding polished gemstones to his eyes for sun protection as he watched fighting gladiators. We know Canadian far north Copper Inuit and Alaskan Yupik wore snow goggles of many kinds made of antlers or whalebone and with tiny horizontal slits. Wearers looked through these and they were protected against the snow’s brilliant light when hunting. At the same time the very narrow eye holes helped them to focus on their prey. In 12th-century China, judges wore sunglasses with smoked quartz lenses to hide their facial expressions — perhaps to retain their dignity or not convey emotions. Very early eyeglasses were produced in Venice with its longstanding skills in glass making concentrated on the still famous islands of Murano. In the 18th century, noble Venetian ladies held green colored glasses in tortoiseshell frames to their eyes, a design similar to a hand-held mirror. These “vetri da gondola” (glasses for gondola) or “da dama” (for ladies) were used to protect their eyes and those of their children from sunlight, as gondoliers paddled them through the Venetian canals. Protection of the eye takes an interesting turn when movie making begins. Film stars’ eyes became strained as artificial studio set lights were very strong. They began to wear tinted glasses outside the studio as their eyes became sore. As Hollywood began to make celebrities of these stars, they sought out privacy by wearing dark glasses on public occasions as well. Their looks were crucial to the industry. One thinks of the aloof Greta Garbo who hid behind her glasses to stop interaction with fans. Audrey Hepburn was another star well known for her Oliver Goldsmith dark glasses. She peered over these in many movies and also wore them as high fashion accessories. The first anti-glare glasses, originally with green glass blocking ultraviolet radiation (UV) rays, were Ray-Bans, patented in 1939 as Aviators for the US Army Air Corps. Their shapes reduced light from any angle. They were taken up by the military and became the signature style of General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of US Forces in the Pacific, stationed in Brisbane, Australia, during the World War II. With these glasses, well-tailored khaki uniforms and peaked caps, wearers exuded a vigorous masculine appeal – although the outfits were not exactly fashion. Dark glasses were to become increasingly popular accessories from the late 1920s. They took on new life as essential male and female fashions in the 1960s and 1970s. Style icons like Jacqueline Kennedy wore her huge designer outsize glasses as personal fashion items. There are hundreds of different designs on the market today. Many can be picked up at any chemist. Dark glasses are everywhere: worn on the street, for driving, on the beach and on the tennis court. Sunglasses are rich with different meanings. They protect from harsh sunlight and shield wearers from close contact with others. They also allow users to observe others without detection. They are striking accessories favored by celebrities, movie stars and fashionable influencers of all kinds. For some celebrities, sunglasses have become part of their character. They project an almost powerful aura for someone like Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. For Stevie Wonder, who wears sunglasses because he is legally blind, they have come to symbolize his particular personality, his unique ability and his iconic status."
"Oliviero Toscani, photographer behind shock Benetton ads, dies age 82",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/style/oliviero-toscani-photographer-benetton-death/index.html,"Oliviero Toscani, the man behind the shock advertising campaigns that helped make Italy’s Benetton one of the world’s biggest clothing brands, died on Monday at the age of 82, his family said in a statement. Toscani was admitted to hospital on Friday in Cecina, near his Tuscan country home, in a very serious condition. A source with knowledge of the matter said on Saturday he had lost consciousness. “It is with great sorrow that we announce the news that today, 13 January 2025, our beloved Oliviero has embarked on his next journey,” Toscani’s wife Kirsti and three children said in the statement. The photographer had revealed in an interview in August with the Corriere della Sera newspaper that he was suffering from amyloidosis, a rare and incurable condition that leads to the build up of amyloid proteins that affect the body’s vital organs. Toscani said he had lost 40 kilograms (88 pounds) in weight in one year and the newspaper published a picture of him looking sickly and emaciated. Toscani, who was born on Feb. 28, 1942, followed in his father’s footsteps by training as a photographer, studying in Zurich and working for a number of fashion magazines where he helped establish the careers of models including Monica Bellucci. However he came to prominence in the 1980s as creative director for Benetton, the family-owned fashion chain based in northern Italy. Toscani put images of a dying AIDS patient and the blood-drenched clothes of a soldier killed in Bosnia on to billboards around the world, stoking controversies that helped to popularize the “United Colors of Benetton” logo. The photographer left Benetton in 2000 after a furore over a campaign featuring images of US prisoners on death row. Toscani and American freelance journalist Ken Shulman interviewed and photographed 26 prisoners awaiting execution in US jails in a campaign which read like a passionate manifesto against capital punishment. “I exploit clothing to raise social issues,” Toscani told Reuters in an interview at the time as the controversy raged over whether the campaign was a step too far. “Traditional advertising says if you buy a certain product you will be beautiful, sexually powerful, successful. All that bullshit doesn’t really exist,” he said. He resumed working for the group in 2017, reestablishing his partnership with Luciano Benetton, one of the company founders, who had returned to try and revive a brand that had been overtaken by nimbler players in the fast fashion sector. However, the Benetton group cut ties with him in 2020 after comments that played down the significance of the 2018 Morandi Bridge disaster which killed 43 people. The bridge in Genoa was operated at the time by a unit of the Benetton family-controlled infrastructure group Atlantia. His work was showcased in an exhibition in Zurich’s Museum fur Gestaltung in 2024 entitled “Photography and Provocation.”"
What relaxation looks like in one of the world’s hardest working countries,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/style/south-korea-leisure-culture-photography-wellness-intl-hnk/index.html,"Outfitted with a large film camera and often dressed in athletic wear, Seoul-based photographer Kim Seunggu has spent almost 15 years capturing the essence of what he calls “leisure culture” — vacationing, poolside unwinding and communal gatherings — in contemporary South Korea. The focus of his ongoing series, “Better Days,” is all the more striking in a country that ranks fourth globally for the longest working hours and where the phenomenon of “gwarosa” (death by overwork) is thought to claim numerous lives annually. In 2023, the South Korean government was forced to abandon plans to increase the maximum working week from 52 to 69 hours amid backlash from Millennial and Gen Z workers. The proposed move was intended to combat the nation’s labor shortage stemming from a declining birth rate and an aging population. According to Kim,  South Korea’s leisure culture  is marked by a yearning for respite from the country’s intense work pressures and fast-paced lifestyles. Kim, 45, started capturing these scenes in 2010, during his graduate studies. His project has taken him to the popular Jangheung Hanok Swimming Pool, its mineral waters set against the backdrop of a traditional Korean house; Royal Azaleas Hill, known for its blooming azaleas; Mulbit Park, which features tranquil nature trails; and various campsites in city parks across the country. As a child, Kim observed the vibrant interactions of everyday people in their free time. As he grew older, he felt compelled to document them. “I felt a newfound fascination with these scenes,” he told CNN in a phone interview. The photographer’s series has garnered critical acclaim, earning him the Grand Prix at the Tokyo International Photography Competition and a shortlist nomination for the BBA Photography Prize Kim’s work has also been showcased in prominent exhibitions at the Gyeonggi Museum of Modern Art and the Seoul Museum of Art. His upcoming book “Better Days” features almost 50 photos from the series and delves deeper into themes of community, recreation and work-life balance. Much like how 20th-century photographers unwittingly captured the fleeting moments of their time — Kim, who says he looks up to American color photographers like Richard Misrach and Joel Sternfeld — has emerged as a chronicler of modern Korean life, revealing the nuanced layers of joy and complexity that define it. In many of Kim’s photographs, bleak cityscapes loom in the background, while lively leisurely pursuits take place in the foreground, producing a stark contrast between the pressures of daily life and the moments of joy that punctuate it. In his photograph of the Hanok swimming spot, Kim showcases a teeming pool framed by traditional Korean architecture of wooden structures and curved roofs, echoing a dialogue between past and present. Children splash in the water, their laughter almost palpable in the air. Parents lounge poolside in colorful swimwear, while others float on inflatable tubes. Meanwhile, in his photograph of Royal Azaleas Hill, pink blossoms dominate the scene, reflecting the significance of seasonal festivities in Korea. Kim’s locations for “Better Days” often focus on the middle class, rather than the upper echelons of Korean society. “Upper-class people tend to be in luxurious, exclusive places that are inaccessible, such as high-end resorts or hotels, making it hard to observe their culture closely,” he said, adding: “I believe that the culture enjoyed by the majority better represents Korean society.” “In the Joseon dynasty, genre paintings often depicted the culture of the common people, much like European genre painters who focused on local festivities and peasant life,” he said, referencing the neo-Confucian dynasty that shaped Korean history from the 14th to the late-19th century. “Such depictions reveal a lot about the era, as upper-class life is often hidden behind layers of luxury, while the open culture of the common people reflects a modern folklore.” To better understand South Korea’s unique leisure culture, Kim looked to its historical backdrop — particularly the cultural stagnation that followed the decades of Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War. “In the 1980s and ‘90s, the push for political reform — especially following the 1987 democratic uprising — sparked a strong desire for freedom and democracy. This led to the acceptance of Western cultures from America and Europe,” he said. Kim added that the pursuit of individualism in Korea coexists with a sense of community, rooted in Confucian values, and a collective yearning for freedom stemming from Japanese occupation and dictatorial regimes. In turn, Kim said, South Korean society became what he called a “flexible community” that blends individualism with mutual trust — and where gatherings among strangers are considered routine and safe. Kim’s photographs serve as a testament to a society that, while grappling with the pressures of long work hours and rapid modernization, finds moments of joy and connection. He insists his work does not directly address political issues, but when asked about various challenges facing South Korea today, from recent political turmoil to a deepening demographic crisis, the photographer said he considers society’s “contradictions” to be “growing pains toward a better democracy and a better world.” He sees these ideas as part of “Better Days,” adding: “Korean society has overcome many challenges through the power of its citizens, and the passion reflected in our leisure culture indicates the potential for improvements.” Long work hours and short breaks have led many Koreans to live close to urban centers, with over 80% of the population living in cities. And within Kim’s photographs there is an intriguing duality — a tension between the oppressive cityscape and the colorful leisure activities of its residents. He frequently employs vivid colors, high-angle shots and distant vantage points, capturing the broader context of social interactions. “People may view the long hours and short vacations in Korea negatively, but I see them as a reflection of individuals adapting to and overcoming challenges, showcasing their diligence,” he said. “We accept these contradictions to some extent, and within that lies a pursuit of satisfaction in leisure. This optimism is evident in Korean leisure culture, which I aimed to express through warm, bright exposures.” He also stressed the importance of his creative process and commitment to “slow photography,” which demands patience as he often spends hours observing before capturing a single image. Somewhat ironically, his documentation of Korea’s evolving leisure culture contains a strong work ethic. “I plan to continue until I can no longer do so,” he said. “Better Days,” published by Kehrer Verlag, is available now."
Royal treasures hidden since World War II recovered from cathedral,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/style/royal-crowns-vilnius-scli-intl/index.html,"Historical treasures hidden for decades have been uncovered in the crypts of a cathedral, with items including burial crowns and insignia belonging to Medieval European rulers. The cache from Vilnius Cathedral, in Lithuania, has not been seen since the outbreak of World War II in 1939, according to a press release from Go Vilnius tourism promotion agency on Wednesday. Items include a crown belonging to Alexander Jagiellon, or Aleksandras Jogailaitis, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, who lived from 1461–1506. Other artifacts include a crown, a chain, a medallion, a ring and a coffin plaque belonging to Elizabeth of Austria, or Elžbieta Habsburgaitė, who lived from 1436–1505. There was also a crown, a scepter, an orb, three rings, a chain and coffin plaques associated with Barbara Radziwiłł, or Barbora Radvilaitė. She was married to Sigismund II Augustus, or Žygimantas Augustas, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and died in 1551. “The discovered burial insignia of the monarchs of Lithuania and Poland are priceless historical treasures, symbols of the long tradition of Lithuanian statehood, signs of Vilnius as the capital city, and magnificent works of goldsmithing and jewellery,” said Vilnius Archbishop Gintaras Grušas in a statement sent to CNN by the Vilnius Archdiocese on Thursday. The artifacts would have been put inside the sarcophagi of the royals when they were laid to rest, and the crowns would not have been worn, instead being made after death to form part of the burial tomb, according to the statement. “This reflects the burial and honouring practices of the time,” the statement adds. “This discovery is of particular importance for our statehood, as it shows the location of Vilnius Cathedral as the necropolis of the elite of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.” “These symbols are important both for the State and for each of us, as signs of European identity, as a reclaimed identity of the old State, as a sign of the strength of our roots,” said Rita Pauliukevičiūtė, director of the Vilnius Church Heritage Museum, in the Archdiocese statement. The items were first discovered in 1931 when the cathedral was being cleaned following a spring flood, revealing a crypt containing the remains of the rulers. They were put on display until World War II broke out in 1939, when they were hidden. Several fruitless searches were carried out before researchers turned their attention to the crypts in September 2024. Using an endoscopic camera, the artifacts were finally recovered in December, wrapped in newspapers dated September 1939. “They will be examined, restored and presented to the public in the future,” according to the archdiocese."
Keyboard jackets and garden ornament bags: Welcome to the new maximalism movement,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/style/maximalism-fashion-style-movement/index.html,"Coco Chanel, possibly apocryphally, once said: “Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off,” establishing the idea that, in her eyes, to be overdressed was a fashion faux pas. It’s a commandment that has informed many fashion houses for decades; take the monochromatic styling of Issey Miyake, or the clean leatherwork of Hermès. Muted, neutral tones, simple silhouettes and chic fabrics have previously found favor in the fashion world thanks to the “quiet luxury” aesthetic, made even more visible by shows like HBO’s boardroom drama “Succession.” (HBO and CNN are owned by the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) Yet recent runway shows by the likes of Valentino, Prada and Ashish indicate maximalist fashion — a style with roots as far back as 17th century Rome — might be staging a loud return. The economic timing certainly feels right too, as maximalism movements often bubble up around times of sustained economic hardship, such as the one gripping much of the post-Covid-19 world right now. In an interview with CNN, Melissa Marra-Alvarez, curator of the 2019 exhibition “Minimalism/Maximalism” at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York explained it thus: “In the broadest terms, if we look back at fashion history, we can see alternating periods of minimalist and maximalist aesthetics in fashion. It is the back-and-forth nature of these two opposing aesthetics that propels fashion forward. “Every time an aesthetic re-appears it is not only expressing the social and political climate of the moment — it is also reacting to what came before it,” Marra-Alvarez added. “For this reason, it’s never the same iteration of minimalist or maximalist expression. It evolves every time.” Indeed the current maximalist movement, popularized on social media, is more extreme and theatrical than ever before. It also brings the look to a whole new demographic that may not have previously experienced earlier iterations of the style. Jaclyn goes by @llolfashiondump on TikTok and has 1.2 million followers. In a Zoom interview with CNN, she said that, for her, maximalism is a way to be “like a walking shrine of my art” — it has become a physical embodiment of her creativity. Through her popular “get dressed with me” videos (which average 200,000 views and can sometimes reach up to 4 million people) Jaclyn challenges the conventions of clothing, wearing jumpers upside down, attaching various accoutrements and layering endless accessories. It’s a style that at times seems cumbersome, presenting its own challenges and needing dedicated sewing techniques. Yet, she said, this is all part of the fun. Myra Magdalen is another prominent TikToker in the maximalist space, who joined a Zoom call with CNN wearing a top embroidered with an image of nail clippers. She has encountered similar issues with attaching heavier embellishments to her outfits, like dolphin lamps or computer mice. The solution? “Multiple (points of) anchoring,” she said. “If you’re going to attach something, especially if it’s heavy, you need to have it where if one point of attachment fails it will not fall off.” Both Jaclyn and Myra enjoy experimenting with bold statement pieces like long nails and decorative headphones. But for those looking to dip their toes into maximalism, fashion stylist Kristine Kilty suggests picking up a statement piece from a thrift store and using the color palette to inform the rest of the outfit. Finding inspiration photos on social media can also combat some of the anxiety people might feel during their first foray into a more experimental style of fashion, said the creative director, who focuses on maximalism, over Zoom. Most importantly, she added, “more is more.” “You can’t really go wrong… It’s not that the outfit isn’t working. You just haven’t finished it yet,” she said. When curating their wardrobes, the US-based Myra and Jaclyn both rely heavily on secondhand clothes, whether from in-person shopping in thrift stores or online platforms like Depop and Vinted. The algorithms have adapted to their unusual tastes, helping Myra find unique pieces — such as a jacket resembling a computer keyboard — to complete her looks. In videos styling these pieces, Myra takes a statement item, like a DIY duck bag, and adds seemingly-endless matching accessories including a duck-patterned skirt, a duck neck necklace and press-on miniature duck nails. Both TikTokers say their creativity is well-received not only on social media but also in real life. While Myra and Jaclyn know when to dress down in jeans and a simple T-shirt, they enjoy the spectacle of wearing bold outfits in public. “It’s such a positive feeling to have confidence in what you do,” said Jaclyn, who admitted that her maximalist clothing originally acted as a mask for insecurities stemming from psoriasis — wearing unusual clothing blurred the reasons behind peoples’ stares. “It radiates into so many other aspects of your life,” she said. Myra’s unique approach to fashion has also caught on among her friendship group which, she said, has become more experimental in its own sartorial choices. Kilty strongly believes that people should use fashion to inspire confidence and creativity. “Fashion can be an armor or it can be a disguise,” she said. “But ultimately, it’s what you feel comfortable in.” For some, this might be sleek silhouettes in muted colors, while for others it’s clashing colors and contrasting patterns. If the latter is you, Kilty had some parting words. Just “go really extreme — don’t hold yourself back.”"

"Significant winter storm shutters the South and cancels more than 3,000 US flights",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/weather/winter-storm-snow-ice-south-texas-climate/index.html,"A significant winter storm is hammering the South with snow and ice, causing major travel disruptions and power outages just a day after it walloped the Plains. The storm had already shut down the South Friday — schools and government offices were closed and states of emergency declared as it started to disrupt travel. More than 3,000 flights in and out of the US were canceled Friday – the worst day for flight cancellations since July – as the storm stretched over nearly every major airport in the South, according to FlightAware. Snow was falling over much of Tennessee early Friday afternoon, including in Memphis and Nashville, while a mix of snow and sleet hit parts of the Southeast — including Atlanta, which has seen its biggest snow in nearly seven years. Areas farther west got the same treatment overnight, resulting in a scene far from a winter wonderland. More than 135,000 homes and businesses were without power in Georgia, Texas and Arkansas amid freezing temperatures by Friday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. Georgia is experiencing the majority of the outages. Snow has piled up in these areas since Thursday. Areas north of the Dallas-Ft. Worth metro recorded up to 8 inches of snow while up to a foot fell near Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. Dallas picked up 2 to 4 inches of snow, marking this storm as the city’s biggest in four years. Southeastern Oklahoma picked up 6 to 10 inches of snow and more than a foot fell in central Arkansas. The sloppy weather created treacherous travel with multiple reports of jackknifed tractor trailers and stuck cars in both northern Texas and southern Oklahoma. All southbound lanes of Interstate 35 in southern Oklahoma turned into a parking lot near Davis after being shut down by a crash. Oklahoma Highway Patrol responded to over 500 traffic collisions Thursday, including 85 crashes involving injuries, the agency said in a post on X. In Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Sanders activated the National Guard to assist stranded drivers, she said on X. Roads were treacherous and impassible in parts of Alabama by Friday morning, according to state officials. All city roads in Calhoun County were closed, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Friday, adding that snow and ice are covering streets. Several crashes and slide-offs were reported in neighboring Mississippi, according to the state’s highway patrol. At least moderate impacts from the storm are expected in parts of the South Friday, according to the Winter Storm Severity Index. A few areas could encounter major impacts from this storm, meaning considerable disruptions to daily life and dangerous travel conditions are likely. That includes Atlanta, where icy sleet fell early Friday morning before changing over to snow. Reports of 1 to 3 inches of snow and sleet were widespread in the Atlanta metro by mid-morning. The city will deal with mixed precipitation much of the day. Icy buildup could lead to power outages in addition to treacherous travel. As temperatures drop below freezing after sunset, slush and standing water on North Georgia roads will quickly freeze again, leading to dangerous travel conditions into Saturday, the National Weather Service in Atlanta warned. Any amount of ice is dangerous; just a thin layer — even a tenth of an inch — can turn paved surfaces into skating rinks, causing people to slip and vehicles to slide out of control, like what occurred over the weekend in the central US. Ice can also weigh down power lines and cause outages. All city of Atlanta government offices are closed Friday and the city has opened multiple warming centers, according to a Wednesday news release. Georgia officials said they learned major lessons from the infamous 2014 “Snowpocalypse” disaster that saw hundreds of cars stranded on icy Atlanta freeways. “We got ahead of the storm,” said Gov. Brian Kemp. “It’s hard to keep up with Mother Nature, but we’re doing our best.” About 20,000 miles of roadway were treated with brine before the first snowflake fell Friday, according to the state Department of Transportation, with more than 300 plows clearing highways. Still, “numerous” crashes and incidents have already been reported on Georgia’s interstates and state routes, the Department of Transportation said in a Friday statement, adding that “conditions on the roads continue to deteriorate and should be considered hazardous for travel.” The Georgia Department of Public Safety said it received over 1,000 calls for service related to weather conditions Friday, with 225 crashes reported. More than 590 flights, or 56%, leaving Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport were canceled by 5 p.m. ET, according to FlightAware. The airport is the busiest airport in the world based on passenger traffic and also a main hub to legacy carrier Delta Air Lines. A ground stop was issued at the Atlanta airport Friday afternoon at the airline’s request, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Two of American Airlines’ major hubs, Charlotte Douglas International Airport and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, also called off many flights for the day, with 43% of departing flights canceled in Charlotte and 23% canceled at DFW, according to FlightAware. Messy snow and an icy mix arrived in parts of the Carolinas Friday afternoon and will impact those states and nearby parts of the mid-Atlantic through Friday night. Charlotte, North Carolina, hasn’t recorded measurable snow — at least 0.1 inch — in nearly two years but likely will break that snow drought. Snow could total 1 to 3 inches in much of the state with more than half a foot in western North Carolina’s mountains into Saturday morning. Western North Carolina was devastated by Hurricane Helene in September and recovery is still ongoing. “We know that those still recovering from Hurricane Helene are especially going to feel the impacts of the storm,” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said Friday. “Crews began preparing for the storm on Wednesday and have been responding to winter weather in the mountains for weeks.” All Helene disaster recovery centers in the region are closed Friday and Saturday for the storm, but plan to reopen Monday morning, officials confirmed at a Friday press conference. More than 100 National Guard troops were stationed ahead of the storm in western and central North Carolina and are ready to respond, officials added. Snow also started to fall in Kentucky, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana Friday as a storm diving south out of Canada interacted with the southern storm and pulled moisture north. Widespread amounts of 1 to 3 inches of snow are expected in Kentucky and parts of the Midwest through Friday night. One to 3 inches of snow will also fall in the Northeast Friday night into Saturday morning.

La Niña has arrived. Here’s what that means for the US,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/weather/la-nina-winter-spring-forecast-climate/index.html,"La Niña has finally emerged after months of anticipation, but there’s a catch. The climate pattern — which typically has an outsized influence on winter weather in the US — is rather weak and may not stick around for long. But that won’t totally eliminate its effect. And, despite its late arrival, it’s already played a clear role in this winter’s weather. Forecasters closely monitor La Niña and its counterpart El Niño because they influence global weather in a way that’s largely consistent and predictable well in advance – especially when the patterns are strong. Last winter was the warmest on record for the US and was dominated by a very strong ”super” El Niño. This winter is different: Not only is La Niña much weaker than last year’s potent El Niño, it’s also arriving really late to the party. Both exert their greatest influence on weather in the winter months, and this La Niña has already lost a lot of time, according to Emily Becker, a research professor at the University of Miami. “It is really getting started right at the time when it would normally be peaking (in strength) and beginning to dwindle,” Becker, who is also one of the main authors of NOAA’s La Niña/El Niño blog, explained. That doesn’t mean its effect on US winter weather is down for the count. The phenomenon is marked by cooler than average water temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, along with corresponding changes in upper atmosphere patterns — and these changes influence weather globally. The atmosphere started to look La Niña-like in the fall, but ocean temperatures didn’t really look like La Niña until the end of the year, Becker explained. So, despite the timing and its weakened state, La Niña’s atmospheric influence has already been apparent this winter. California is the most obvious example. Winter in Northern California is typically wetter during La Niña while the southern half of the state is drier than normal. Those extremes are playing out in a major way: Northern California has had plenty of rain while Southern California is so tinder-dry that thousands of acres ignited this week. La Niña also typically delivers more precipitation to the Midwest. Multiple major Midwest cities — including St. Louis, Indianapolis and Cincinnati — are having one of the wettest starts to winter to date, according to data from the Southeast Regional Climate Center. But there are also exceptions that prove La Niña is not the only factor at play this season. The South and parts of the central US are typically drier and warmer than normal during a La Niña winter, but that’s been far from the case for at least the past few weeks. Periods of brutally cold Arctic air have dominated the eastern two-thirds of the country since December and winter storms have delivered disruptive weather on a weekly basis since the year began. The weak La Niña is forecast to stick around through April before yielding once again to so-called neutral — not La Niña or El Niño — conditions, according to the Climate Prediction Center. Trends for the rest of winter and into the early spring are still showing La Niña’s influence but it’s not guaranteed the season will play out exactly like a typical La Niña. “If La Niña were stronger, I would have more confidence … that the rest of the winter would closely resemble La Niña’s expected impact,” Becker explained, noting that the weaker La Niña leaves room for other atmospheric factors to exert influence. Despite this, warmer than normal temperatures are expected to win out over much of the southern tier of the US and East from January through March, according to the CPC. Cooler than normal conditions are anticipated for some northwestern states, also typical of La Niña. Wetter than normal conditions likely continue in the Northwest and Midwest and parts of the Northeast through March. More precipitation coupled with colder weather could be a recipe for bouts of snow into early spring. Much of the southern US is expected to end up drier than normal, but parts of the Mississippi Valley and Southeast could be the exception. Long-range forecasters at the CPC first raised the possibility of a switch to La Niña back in February 2024 when El Niño was still very strong. At the time, experts thought La Niña would arrive over the summer or fall and increase hurricane activity in the Atlantic. El Niño finally lost its grip on global weather in June, but La Niña’s arrival was delayed repeatedly, leaving an extended period of neutral conditions in place through the summer and fall. It turned out hurricane season didn’t need La Niña in order to deliver devastating impacts anyway. The delay likely ties back to global ocean temperatures, which have been far above average for more than a year, according to Becker. Global air temperatures were also extreme in 2024, which will likely be the first year on record to smash a critical warming limit. It proved difficult for the equatorial Pacific to cool off into a La Niña phase when the surrounding oceans and atmosphere retained so much exceptional heat."
Fast Facts: Wildfire trends in the US,https://edition.cnn.com/weather/us-wildfire-fast-facts-dg/index.html,"Over the last couple decades, wildfires have increased in number and size, particularly in western states. This is likely due to climate change, which can affect precipitation, wind, temperature, vegetation and other factors that drive wildfires. These longer, more active fire seasons combined with increased housing have put more homes at risk. One study found the number of houses within wildfire perimeters has doubled since 1990."
"A winter storm is about to paint 1,400 miles of the South with snow and ice, threatening major impacts",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/weather/winter-storm-cold-south-texas-climate/index.html,"A disruptive winter storm will soon paint the South with snow, ice and rain as the eastern two-thirds of the United States grapples with the coldest air of the season. Unusually cold temperatures have dipped deep into the South and will allow the storm to put out a few inches of snow and dangerous ice over a nearly 1,400 mile section of the South from North Texas to the North Carolina coast, threatening major to extreme impacts in a region less adapted to winter weather. Around 80,000 homes and businesses from Missouri to Virginia were still without power Wednesday morning after the last winter storm, according to PowerOutage.us. Some have been without power since Sunday, enduring the dangerous cold temperatures that are cold even for the coldest month of the year. Spotty wintry weather from the new storm will begin Wednesday night in western Texas with light snow and freezing drizzle as the storm organizes. Thursday will be the most impactful day for winter weather for much of the southern Plains as the storm hits its stride. Snow and sleet could begin around sunrise Thursday in northern Texas, including in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and continue through Thursday night. Some freezing rain could mix in during the afternoon as temperatures briefly climb just above freezing. A similar mix will begin Thursday morning in Oklahoma and Arkansas. More mixing will keep snow totals a bit lower than initially forecast but will also create hazardous conditions by introducing ice to a larger population. Any amount of ice is dangerous; just a thin layer — even a tenth of an inch — can turn paved surfaces into skating rinks, causing people to slip and vehicles to slide out of control, like what occurred over the weekend in the central US. At least moderate impacts from the storm are expected in parts of Texas and Oklahoma given the threat for snow and ice, according to the Winter Storm Severity Index. A few areas could encounter major or even extreme impacts from this storm, meaning considerable disruptions to daily life and dangerous travel conditions are likely. Frigid temperatures will increase power demands in Texas but grid conditions are expected to be normal, ERCOT — the operator responsible for the state’s electrical grid — said in a weather watch issued Sunday. The state’s grid failed during 2021’s disastrous winter storm and prolonged deep freeze, resulting in the deaths of more than 200 people. Rain and perhaps a few embedded thunderstorms will soak central and south Texas, including Austin and Houston, Thursday. Flooding is possible, especially in coastal Texas where heavy thunderstorms that bubble to life just off the coast could slowly push ashore. The storm will track farther east Thursday night and Friday and bring messy winter weather to much of the South. Small shifts in its track are still possible and could change snow and ice outcomes. Snow totals will be highest from far northeast Texas and southeast Oklahoma through Tennessee and the southern Appalachians. Several inches of snow could fall across this area and eclipse half a foot in spots from central Arkansas to the southern Appalachians. Northern portions of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia could record 3 inches or more of snow from Thursday night through Friday night. Some of these areas could start as snow but change over to an icy mix as warmer air enters the area. This will likely be the case in Atlanta, which hasn’t had at least an inch of snow in nearly seven years, but has a moderate chance of it with this storm. Precipitation begins as snow early Friday morning but will mix with freezing rain in the afternoon through the evening as temperatures warm to near freezing. Precipitation quickly expands east Friday night as the storm approaches the Atlantic Coast and a mix of snow and ice will reach the Carolinas. Charlotte, North Carolina, hasn’t recorded measurable snow – at least 0.1 inch – in nearly two years but likely breaks that snow drought by this weekend. Early forecasts hinted at the possibility that the storm could deliver significant snow to the mid-Atlantic and Northeast by the weekend, but that scenario is appearing less likely. Still, a separate storm diving south out of Canada could work in tandem with the southern storm to pull moisture north and spread precipitation to much of the East. A quick round of snow totaling 1 to 3 inches or less is possible for much of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday night into early Saturday morning. The storm quickly clears out of the East Saturday morning, leaving gusty winds in its wake, especially near the coast. CNN Meteorologist Elisa Raffa contributed to this report."

"Former ‘Kiddy Kapers’ TV star died when California wildfires ripped through Malibu estate, mother says",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/australia/rory-sykes-malibu-la-fires-intl-latam/index.html,"A former child star from Australia died when the Los Angeles wildfires ripped through his family’s Malibu estate in California earlier this week, according to his mother. Rory Callum Sykes was at the family’s 17-acre Mount Malibu TV Studios estate, where he had his own cottage, when it burned down on January 8, his mother Shelley Sykes wrote on X Thursday. Shelley Sykes described her son, who appeared on the 1998 British TV series “Kiddy Kapers,” as “beautiful” and “wonderful” and said she was “totally heart broken” by his death. She said she had tried to put out the wildfire cinders on her property’s roof using a hose but couldn’t because the water wasn’t working. “He said, ‘mom leave me’ and no mom can leave their kid. And I’ve got a broken arm, I couldn’t lift him, I couldn’t move him,” Sykes told Australia’s 10 News First. Her son, 32, was born blind with cerebral palsy on July 29, 1992, and had become famous for his speeches on overcoming disability. He was the co-founder of Happy Charity, which according to its site offers, “Hope, Happiness & Health to those that are Hurting.” “He overcame so much with surgeries and therapies to regain his sight and to be able to learn to walk. Despite the pain, he still enthused about traveling the world with me from Africa to Antarctica,” Shelley Sykes wrote on X. She said her son was born in Britain but lived in Australia, then America. He was “a gift born on mine and his grandma’s birthday,” she wrote. On his website, Sykes describes himself as a professional speaker and consultant for many companies including the Tony Robbins Foundation, and the Cerebral Palsy Alliance. In an appearance with his mother on Australian television show “Mornings with Kerri-Anne” in 2003, he discussed going on a trip to the United States to speak at a Tony Robbins motivational conference. “It doesn’t matter what happens to you in life, it’s what you do about it that counts,” he told viewers. A spokesperson for Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) told CNN that it is aware of the death of an Australian citizen and is “engaging closely with local authorities” to assist his family. “The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular assistance to his family. Our thoughts are with them,” the spokesperson said."

Protests turn violent in China after student falls to his death,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/china/china-protest-pucheng-student-death-intl/index.html,"Violent protests have erupted in China after the death of a teenage boy sparked accusations of a cover-up by authorities, videos from the northwestern region of Shaanxi have shown. In videos verified by CNN, dozens of protesters are seen confronting a wall of riot police outside the Pucheng Vocational Technical School, with some hurling batons and other objects towards the officers. One of the protesters was seen hurling a fire extinguisher at a door, shattering its glass. In response, police are seen aggressively handling the demonstrators, beating some and throwing others to the ground. The trigger for the protests was the death of a teenage student, whose surname was Dang and who was in his third year at the school. Local authorities in Pucheng have claimed Dang’s death on January 2 was an accident and not criminal, but allegations have swirled on social media that there has been a cover-up. Chinese authorities have been particularly wary of public protests in the country following the widespread “White Paper” demonstrations in late 2022 against Beijing’s hardline policies during the Covid-19 pandemic. According to a statement from investigators posted on the Pucheng county government’s website, Dang “had a verbal and physical altercation” with a first-year student surnamed Guo over “disturbing his rest” in his dormitory. That night, a school official helped resolve the argument. At around 3 a.m., another student in Dang’s dormitory went to the restroom, where he found a wooden stool underneath the balcony window, according to the statement. “The sliding window was open, and the metal mesh screen has been removed. Dang had already fallen from the window to the ground below,” it said. Human Rights In China, a US-based activist group, reported “suspicious circumstances” leading to Dang’s death, including witness reports of “signs of a struggle in Dang’s dormitory” and the suggestion that he was “pushed from the roof.” The group said Dang’s family has rejected the official explanation of his death. The family also claimed that photos from his cell phone had been deleted, Reuters reported. The family’s skepticism has been amplified widely on social media. It is unclear whether the protests, which began Monday, continued throughout the week. Calls by CNN to the public security bureau of Pucheng county, as well as that of Weinan city – which the county is part of – went unanswered."
Ukraine says it has hit one of Russia’s largest oil refineries in a drone strike,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/europe/ukraine-drone-strike-russia-oil-refinery-intl-latam/index.html,"Ukraine claimed Saturday to have struck one of Russia’s largest oil refineries in a drone attack, starting a fire at the facility more than 700 miles into Russian territory. The attack on the Taneco refinery in the city of Nizhnekamsk, Tatarstan – one of the largest and most modern refineries in Russia – was the second time the facility had been struck by Ukrainian forces within the space of a year, according to Lieutenant Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation. Social media images geolocated by CNN appear to show massive flames and smoke in the dark skies as workers trudge through the snow evacuating from the fiery building. Despite the footage, the press service of the Republic of Tatarstan denied there had been a fire at the plant, insisting instead that it had been carrying out a mock evacuation as a safety exercise and that the images of the glowing facility in fact showed “the work of the plant’s torches.” The Taneco refinery has a refining capacity of over 16 million tons of oil per year and “plays a key role in supplying fuel to the Russian army,” according to the Ukrainian official Kovalenko. “The destruction of refineries and oil depots directly affects Russia’s ability to wage an intense war,” he added. Kovalenko said the refinery had also been hit in the spring of 2024, in an attack that damaged its primary processing unit. Last April, Ukrainian drone attacks in Tatarstan targeted both a Shahed drone assembly factory and a primary oil refining unit at the refinery, one of the five largest such facilities in Russia, sources told CNN at the time. The attack last April was at the time the farthest into Russian territory Ukraine had struck since the beginning of the war."

Zelensky says two North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia were captured in Kursk region,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/europe/zelensky-north-korean-soldiers-korea-intl/index.html,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said forces operating in the Kursk region of Russia have captured two North Korean soldiers, marking the first time that Kyiv has captured alive soldiers from the isolated state. “Our soldiers have captured North Korean military personnel in the Kursk region. Two soldiers, though wounded, survived and were transported to Kyiv, where they are now communicating with the Security Service of Ukraine,” Zelensky said Saturday in a statement on X, which included several images of the injured soldiers. According to Ukrainian and Western assessments, some 11,000 North Korean troops are deployed in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces occupy several hundred square kilometers after staging a cross-border incursion in August last year. Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed or wounded in Kursk in the last week of December. Zelensky said of the two Korean soldiers who had been captured: “This was not an easy task: Russian forces and other North Korean military personnel usually execute their wounded to erase any evidence of North Korea’s involvement in the war against Ukraine.” The Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU, released video purportedly showing the soldiers. In the video, the SBU spokesman says one of the North Koreans was captured on January 9 by Ukrainian special forces, and the other by Ukrainian paratroopers. “They are being held in appropriate conditions that meet the requirements of international law,” the SBU said. The video shows the two soldiers in bunk beds in a cell. One has a wound to his jaw. Neither is heard speaking. An unidentified doctor says that the second soldier has a fractured leg. The SBU spokesman said that “communication with them is carried out through interpreters of Korean,” in cooperation with South Korean intelligence services. Saturday’s capture is the first time that Ukraine has caught North Korean soldiers alive from the battlefield. The SBU released images of a Russian military ID card issued in the name of another person from Tuva in Russia, which it said was being carried by one of the captured soldiers. According to the SBU, the soldier said he had been issued the document in Russia last autumn. He also said that some of North Korea’s combat units had just one week of training with Russian troops. The other captive had no documents, the SBU said. The soldier said he had been in the North Korean military and had thought he was being sent to Russia for training rather than combat, according to the SBU’s account. It comes as Ukraine on Sunday renewed its offensive on Kursk, where its troops have been holding territory after last summer’s shock incursion. Ukraine’s military said on Tuesday that it had conducted a precision strike on a Russian military command post near the town of Belaya. Although Kyiv’s troops quickly advanced through Kursk in the summer – in the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – Russia eventually managed to push the forces back. The lines had been mostly static for weeks before Ukraine’s latest push. In his daily address on Monday, Zelensky said the Kursk offensive was important in preventing Russia from redirecting its troops to Donetsk and other regions in eastern and southern Ukraine. Despite both sides being drained after nearly three years of war, frontline fighting has ramped up in recent weeks. With Donald Trump set to return to the White House this month – promising to end the war in a day, without saying how – Moscow and Kyiv appear to be making an 11th-hour push to gobble up territory and strengthen their negotiating hands ahead of potential peace talks. This story has been updated."
Germany tows disabled Russian ‘shadow fleet’ tanker adrift in Baltic Sea,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/europe/germany-russia-shadow-fleet-tanker-intl/index.html,"Germany is working to secure a drifting Russian oil tanker, believed to be part of Moscow’s “shadow fleet” used to fund its war in Ukraine, after it lost control in the Baltic Sea. The Eventin tanker, carrying nearly 100,000 tons of oil thought to be from Russia, lost power near the German island of Rügen on Friday, Germany’s Central Command for Maritime Emergencies (CCME) said. By Saturday, three tugboats were still working to tow the 274-meter-long Panamanian-flagged tanker to safety. The Eventin departed from Russia and was headed for Egypt, according to MarineTraffic, a monitoring group. CCME said the tugboat convoy was working to tow the Eventin to Sassnitz, a port on Rügen, but that the stormy conditions were “slowing the towing process considerably.” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the “decrepit” oil tanker was another example of the danger Russia poses to European security. Since Western countries sanctioned Russia’s oil exports, the Kremlin has relied on old, sometimes Soviet-era tankers – known as its “shadow fleet” – to transport oil to buyers across the world. “With the unscrupulous use of a fleet of rusting tankers, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin not only circumvents sanctions but also deliberately accepts the risk of halting tourism in the Baltic Sea region,” Baerbock said Friday. The Kremlin, which has previously refused to respond to accusations that it uses a “shadow fleet,” has not yet commented on the incident. The West has grown increasingly alarmed by Russia’s dependence on this aging fleet, which has wreaked environmental havoc in the Black Sea and implicated in damage to vital undersea cables off the Baltic coast. In December, two Russian tankers were wrecked off the coast of occupied Crimea, spilling thousands of tons of fuel into the Black Sea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the ships – nearly 50 years old – “shouldn’t have been in operation at all.” Those two tankers carried around 10,000 tons of fuel between them – 10 times less than the Eventin. Later in December, Finnish authorities seized a tanker traveling from Russia, on suspicion it had used its anchor to damage an undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia. German authorities said no oil leaks had been detected after the Eventin lost power on Friday, but warned of strong winds and waves of up to 2.5 meters (over 8 feet). Zelensky called the tanker “an oil bomb that, fortunately, didn’t detonate.” “Every day, Russia bombards Ukraine, and it finances its missiles, strike drones, and guided bombs, in part, with profits from its tanker fleet. Russia jeopardizes the environment solely to sustain its ability to kill people,” he said Friday. Also on Friday, the outgoing Biden administration targeted Russia’s energy sector, including its so-called “shadow fleet,” with some of its harshest sanctions to date. Zelensky welcomed the move. The sanctions target nearly 200 oil-carrying vessels, many thought to be part of the fleet. A senior administration official said: “We expect our actions to cost Russia upwards of billions of dollars per month.” In December 2022, the Group of Seven (G7) nations capped the price of Russian oil at $60 per barrel. The cap was designed to be enforced by companies that provide shipping, insurance and other services for Russian oil. If a buyer agreed to pay more than the cap, the companies would withhold their services. To dodge these sanctions, Russia has used aging, often uninsured tankers flagged in countries that do not observe the G7 sanctions. The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a Finnish think-tank, said 420 vessels exported Russian crude oil and oil products last month, of which 234 were “shadow tankers,” and 30% of these were at least 20 years old."

$1-billion Dubai skyscrapers to be linked by daring rooftop pool,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/style/dubai-skyscrapers-penthouse-pool-regent/index.html,"Two new 591-foot-tall skyscrapers, linked across the top by a daring “sky pool,” are set to rise above Dubai’s Marasi Marina. But the soaring 43-foot infinity pool will not be accessible to the public, or even to most of the luxury towers’ residents — it’s part of what its architects describe as an exclusive “ultra-penthouse.” Comprising 63 luxury residences, the new Regent Residences Dubai will be worth an estimated $1 billion upon its completion in 2027. The 35,000-square-foot penthouse features six bedrooms, a gym and a private elevator. The project’s other apartments, which all measure upwards of 6,500 square feet, will each occupy an entire floor. They were orientated to offer views of the marina and the nearby Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building. And residents need not worry about missing out on the “sky pool”: All the apartments contain their own private swimming terraces (and access to another 82-foot indoor lap pool). A series of newly released renderings show the staggered pool terraces jutting out from the two towers’ facades. The design was “inspired by cascading water,” according to Foster + Partners, the architecture firm behind the project. Real estate company Sankari (which developed the project alongside IHG Hotels & Resorts)  declined to disclose to CNN how much the “ultra-penthouse” will cost, though the other residences start at $10 million each. Advertised as the “jewel in Dubai’s crown,” the luxury development also features 10 floating homes dubbed “water villas.” Residents will enjoy access to tennis and padel courts, outdoor lounges, a private cinema and virtual golf simulator, among much else. The podium at the base of the towers will meanwhile feature open green spaces, restaurants and retail space. The project is part of a major overhaul of the waterfront Marasi Marina neighborhood in Business Bay, a new high-rise development on the Dubai Creek, south of the city’s downtown area. It is Regent Residences’ first property in the Middle East. The two towers are not identical though they share “same design language,” according to Foster + Partners. In a press statement, the firm’s studio head Gerard Evenden said the project’s “dynamic twisting form and articulated facade” will make it “a distinctive new addition” to Dubai. Foster + Partners, which was founded by the celebrated architect — and winner of the Pritzker Prize, the profession’s equivalent to a Nobel — Norman Foster, has designed numerous other high-profile buildings in the United Arab Emirates in recent years. Among them are an 80-story Dubai skyscraper, called The Index, and the House of Wisdom, a library and culture center in Sharjah. The firm’s sculptural Zayed National Museum, which will serve as the centerpiece of Abu Dhabi’s new Saadiyat Island Cultural District, is due to open later this year. It is not the first time a swimming pool has been suspended between buildings: London’s see-through Sky Pool, built across the 10th stories of two residential towers, opened in the British capital’s Nine Elms neighborhood in 2021."
AC/DC was born in this house. A developer mistakenly demolished it,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/style/acdc-house-mistakenly-demolished-australia-intl-scli/index.html,"The family home where rock band AC/DC was founded has been mistakenly demolished by a property developer in Australia. Located in the Sydney suburb of Burwood, 4 Burleigh Street had long been a place visited by the band’s fans from around the world. AC/DC’s Malcolm and Angus Young lived in the house as teenagers when they were founding the band, along with their brother George Young, a guitarist for another wildly popular rock group, the Easybeats. The family migrated to Australia from Scotland, living first in a migrant hostel before moving to Burleigh Street in 1965. When the Easybeats made it big, a mini riot once reportedly unfolded outside the house when a fan magazine disclosed the address. Hundreds of girls from local high schools descended upon the house and twenty forced their way inside – trampling a young Angus on their way, according to the home’s listing on Australia’s National Trust Register. The one-story, two-bedroom brick house was bought by a property developer in March 2023 for 5.8 million Australian dollars ($3.6 million). It demolished the building last month, according to CNN affiliate Nine News. The developer, Burwood Square, told Nine News that it didn’t know about the cultural importance of the home, despite conducting due diligence on the site. “Unfortunately the historical connection to AC/DC was not identified, and we regret the previous long-term owner did not share this vital part of the property’s background with us,” said Leon Kamita, the company’s general manager. “Learning about this connection after our plans were already underway has shocked us,” he said in a statement. The developers plan to turn the lot into a 144 meter (472 foot) 50-story tower with 120 hotel rooms and 48 affordable housing apartments, according to Nine News. The suburban home, a bungalow built in the “Federation style” that was mass produced in the early 20th century, had been in “poor condition” since the Young family left it in 1978, according to a review published by the Burwood Council. In 1985, it became a brothel – with local newspapers promoting “Adult Work Opportunities” at the address, according to the council. It later served as a medical practice and was being rented out to an unspecified tenant at the time of the developer’s purchase. An article published in the Sydney Morning Herald back in 2003 argued for the building to be protected from the hands of developers. “There is however, one domicile begging for immediate acquisition and deification; a small, simple dwelling at 4 Burleigh Street,” wrote rock historian Glenn A. Baker. Although the house was listed on the Australian National Trust Register in 2013, it did not receive historical protection to prevent its demolition. Burwood Council conducted a review in 2015 to determine whether it should be listed as a heritage site. Ultimately, it did not recommend a heritage listing, citing among its reasons that the band’s “period of habitation was too brief to be relevant to the life and work of AC/DC.” The review also said the home “does not meet the criteria for aesthetic significance,” nor did it have “any known technical or research value.” In a statement sent to CNN, the council said “it has long-maintained that the Young House … has a special association with Australia’s rock music history as the site where band AC/DC formed.” Despite not recommending the heritage listing, the council said it continues to undertake initiatives to celebrate the band’s legacy, including the commissioning of a mural near the site. In its statement to Nine News, Burwood Square said it is “dedicated” to celebrating the location and is salvaging materials from the demolition to create a special space where fans can gather to celebrate the band’s legacy. CNN has reached out to representatives of AC/DC for comment."
Is Uzbekistan the next great architectural destination?,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/style/uzbekistan-architecture-destination-tashkent/index.html,"Driving through Tashkent feels like flipping through an architecture picture book teeming with examples of Soviet brutalist, orientalist, modernist, futurist and neoclassical styles. One marvel after another, buildings in Uzbekistan’s capital city whiz by like a carousel for design lovers. After an earthquake leveled much of its infrastructure in 1966, Tashkent became a laboratory of urbanism. Architects arrived en masse to rebuild roads, apartment blocks, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, metro stations and a panoply of public structures that offered different takes on progressive socialist living. Today, new landmarks designed by the firms of “starchitects” such as the late Zaha Hadid and Tadao Ando are in the works, as well as an “Olympic City” comprising five state-of-the-art sports  venues  for the 2025 Asian Youth Olympic Games. Beyond the capital, the cities of Bukhara, Samarkand and Khiva contain an array of ancient “toki” (domed markets), “madrasa” (schools) and “caravanserai” (inns) built for traders who traversed the Silk Road. Now, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s government is pouring resources into highlighting this rich architectural legacy as part of a campaign to open the former USSR republic to the world. Conservation work on its historic sites is a top priority. “By preserving and restoring these unique architectural treasures, we position Uzbekistan as a global cultural destination,” said Gayane Umerova, chairperson of the Uzbekistan Art & Culture Development Foundation (ACDF) in a statement to CNN. The investment, she added, will be paid off “through increased tourism revenue, job creation, urban revitalization, and cultural branding, as well as preserving and reimagining our heritage in this new era.” Reimagining a collective identity is something of a preoccupation for a nation that only gained its independence from the USSR in 1991. Within Uzbekistan, where 60% of the population is under 30 years old, not everyone is particularly enamored with vestiges of its Soviet past. Young Uzbeks often opt to live in Western-style apartments and point to the gleaming towers in the international business district, including the sprawling Tashkent City Mall, as points of pride. Inevitably, generic glass-and-steel modernity sometimes buts against preservationists’ agendas. The demolition of the iconic Dom Kino cinema house —  to make way for a business park — in 2017, in particular, spurred heritage advocates to action. Over the past three years, ACDF has held 10 exhibitions in 10 countries, including shows at Paris’ Louvre Museum and the Milan Triennale. It has also convened conferences (one of which was headlined by celebrated Dutch architecture theorist Rem Koolhaas and another featured experts from UNESCO, the Guggenheim, Venice Heritage and the British Council), developed a “Tashkent Modernism” app, and commissioned a meticulously researched 900-page book titled “Tashkent Modernism XX/XXI.” Getting influential voices outside of Uzbekistan to rally behind unloved local treasures has, historically, proven to be effective, according to Ekaterina Golovatyuk, a Milan-based architect, researcher and co-editor of “Tashkent Modernism.” “Nobody really cared about Soviet modernism until that book by Frédéric Chaubin,” she said, referring to the hugely popular coffee-table book “CCCP: Cosmic Communist Constructions,” a 2011 architectural survey of 14 former Soviet republics published by Taschen. French photographer Chaubin’s travelogue, she said, spurred architectural expeditions like Canadian photographer Christopher Herwig’s catalog of Soviet bus stops and Garage Museum’s Soviet modernism guidebook series. “People … started saying, ‘If somebody is traveling from so far away and actually covering it in such a regional way, that must mean something. We might have been underestimating the relevance of this,’” Golovatyuk added. Social media influencers who introduce their followers to Uzbekistan’s under-the-radar wonders are helping, too. “It gives visibility to this architecture and transforms it into some sort of cultural and artistic product — something that you don’t perceive when you walk past it every day in the city,” Golovatyuk said. Amid the current construction boom, Uzbekistan is again serving as a magnet for progressive building ideas, just as it did in the 1960s and 1970s. This time, however, the most consequential issue is sustainability. Wael Al Awar, the Lebanese architect co-curating the Uzbekistan’s inaugrual Bukhara Biennial, says the country’s ancient cities are teeming with green solutions. Buildings are responsible for almost 40% of global carbon emissions, and Al Awar points to the “standardization and globalization in architecture” as a culprit, adding that contemporary concrete buildings have also resulted in a homogenization of the world’s skylines. “Uzbekistan’s structures, in contrast, are contextual,” he said “They’re made by local communities who know the weather and the climate, and respond to that when they build. This is something we’ve lost.” Most ancient buildings in Uzbekistan are naturally energy-efficient, according to Takhmina Turdialieva, co-founder of the Tashkent-based collective, Tatalab, referring to the historic public buildings and dwellings found in Uzbekistan’s Silk Road cities. “It’s very pleasant in the summer and (buildings stay) warm during the winter because of the choice of construction materials and well-designed air circulation. If we learn those passive design methods, we don’t need any new technologies to make buildings more sustainable,” she said. “Modern architecture in Uzbekistan should be based on traditional construction materials like brick and clay,” she added. “We can express different designs with those eco-friendly materials and keep traditions in mind. I think this is how we express modern Uzbek,” she says. This new vision of modernity is taking shape in New Tashkent City, a 20,000-hectare extension of Uzbekistan’s capital that posits to become a locus of sustainable design ideas. Zaha Hadid Architects’ winning design for the Alisher Navoi International Scientific Research Centre, for instance, uses locally made bricks to achieve the firm’s signature avant-garde swooping structures Turdialieva, who also leads the Young Architect’s Association of Uzbekistan, adds that a global spotlight on Uzbek design could help invigorate the country’s next generation of architects. “Maybe this will be a starting point when more attention will be paid to local architects so they can better develop their potential,” she said."
11 architecture projects set to shape the world in 2025,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/style/new-buildings-architecture-2025/index.html,"The past year has seen the opening of the world’s second-tallest skyscraper, the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral and the announcement of countless futuristic urban mega-projects. Yet, the architecture world has, increasingly, recognized the value of altogether humbler pursuits. In March, the industry’s most prestigious accolade, the Pritzker Prize, was unexpectedly awarded to Japanese housing pioneer Riken Yamamoto, while a small school in suburban Australia was later named the best new building at the World Architecture Festival. So, while 2025 will, as ever, be one that celebrates grand infrastructure projects and feats of engineering, smaller-scale designs — and those with genuine environmental credentials — may also find themselves in the global spotlight. From innovative timber buildings to one of Asia’s largest new airports, here are 11 projects opening in the next 12 months. The world’s third largest fish market is getting even bigger. More than eight years after the New South Wales government announced the relocation of Sydney’s historic fish market — which dates to the 1870s but has been on its current site since 1966 — the gleaming new four-floor building is opening on an adjacent 3.6-hectare site. Designed by 3XN Architects and Australian firm BVN (which promises visitors a “multi-sensory fish market experience”), the reimagined facility balances tourist infrastructure with the functional realities of a working wholesale market. Logistics and operations are hidden away in the basement, while the upper floors contain a market hall for visitors and an auction hall where restaurateurs and retailers bid on fresh catches as they arrive via pontoons. The project will also help rejuvenate an industrial part of the harbor with shops, restaurants, a promenade and an urban park, while the distinctive undulating roof is topped with 350 triangular solar panels. From April to October, Japan’s second city Osaka plans to welcome an estimated 28 million visitors to Expo 2025, which will see around 40 countries build custom pavilions on site. The centerpiece, however, is the venue itself: The Grand Ring, a continuous circular wooden structure, more than 1.2 miles in circumference, that will take visitors around the vast site. Expo venues can serve as an expression of their host’s design ethos. When Osaka first hosted the Expo, in 1970, it erected a huge space-frame roof by the most celebrated avant-garde Japanese architects of the time. So, in an age where timber buildings offer an alternative to carbon-intensive concrete, it seems fitting that the Grand Ring’s creator Sou Fujimoto is presenting a distinctly Japanese take on the global trend. Using local cedar and cypress wood (as well as Scottish pine), the architect’s vision combines modern construction methods with the wooden joints traditionally used in Japanese temples and shrines. At almost 646,000 square feet, it will be among the world’s largest wooden buildings. Although intended to be temporary, there is ongoing debate about whether — or how — the structure might be preserved. The UK’s University of Oxford may be closely associated with grand gothic architecture, but it also operates in an ever-evolving portfolio of contemporary properties scattered through the city. The latest of them, a new 270,000-square-foot life sciences building, concludes the largest construction project ever undertaken in the institution’s centuries-long history. The design principles of the Life and Mind Building reflect an academic one: that uniting the departments of experimental psychology, plant sciences and zoology under one roof will encourage greater collaboration and engagement between them. Inside, flexible lab spaces accommodate the needs of the different disciplines while a public plaza offers the chance of more casual interactions. Despite plenty of modern touches, the American architecture practice behind the project, NBBJ, nods to the university’s architectural heritage through stone facades and projected buttresses that produce what it calls a “a timeless but recognizable appearance.” Organic architecture is often celebrated for blending (or even disappearing completely) into the landscape, leaving as little trace on the surroundings as possible. There’s perhaps no better example among this year’s new openings than architecture firm Sordo Madaleno’s Canadian School in Cholula, Mexico. The serene campus looks to the region’s topography for inspiration — namely a nearby pre-Hispanic pyramid and the Popocatépetl volcano, which serves as a dramatic backdrop. The school is arranged around seven circular structures that take the form of overlapping hills, their terraced surfaces providing green spaces for students to explore. Mexican architect Fernando Sordo Madaleno, grandson of the firm’s late founder Juan Sordo Madaleno, said in a statement that as well as blending with the environment, “the building itself becomes part of the playground.” Cambodia is replacing its capital Phnom Penh’s international airport with one capable of handling six times as many visitors. Part of the country’s ambitious bid to boost tourism numbers and become a regional aviation hub, the new Techo International Airport’s initial capacity of 13 million annual passengers will eventually rise to 30 million. The terminal building, located 12 miles south of the city center, will be one of Southeast Asia’s largest. Plans to generate energy through an onsite solar farm also put it among the world’s greenest, according to architects Foster + Partners. With a form inspired by traditional Cambodian design, the terminal’s main roof is supported by a series of structural timber “trees” (real trees will also rise through a large central void). Digital renderings show the structure’s gridded steel shell filtering daylight and illuminating an interior bursting with tropical greenery, while passengers will reach their gates via two airfoil-shaped wings. A major expansion of Boston’s South Station, the busiest ground transport hub in New England, is wrapping up this year. Upon completion, the redevelopment project will have increased the terminal’s bus and rail capacity by 50% and 70%, respectively. Architecturally speaking, the challenge facing American firm Pelli Clarke & Partners was not only to reimagine the hub’s concourse and erect a soaring 51-story skyscraper above it, but to respect the original Classical Revival station building. Listed under the US National Register of Historic Places, it has stood there since 1899. The resulting contrast — between gleaming glass and weathered stone — was always going to be stark. But the tower’s soft, sculptural form seeks to complement its historic counterpart. The expanded, arched concourse meanwhile offers visitors a more grandiose arrival into the city. The first ever African winner of the Pritzker Prize, an award dubbed the “Nobel of architecture,” Francis Kéré is using his global profile to transform the built environment in his home continent. The Burkinabè architect is a longstanding champion of “vernacular” design, which looks to traditional building materials and construction techniques. And his vision for the new Senegalese branch of Goethe-Institut, the German cultural exchange center, is a case in point. The 18,300-square-foot building’s gentle curves were designed to mirror the outline of the surrounding canopies. It was constructed primarily from locally sourced bricks, which are made from compacted earth and arranged in lattice formations to encourage natural ventilation. Speaking to CNN in 2022, Kéré explained the importance of local materials, saying: “The more… you use, the better you can promote the local economy and (build) local knowledge, which also makes people proud.” More than a decade after the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing opened to become, arguably, China’s best-known contemporary building, its co-designer Ole Scheeren continues to leave his footprint on the county. The German architect’s firm, Büro Ole Scheeren, currently has major projects underway in various Chinese cities, from Shenzhen to Nanjing. Among the most striking among is Urban Glen, a pair of dramatically stepped towers containing nearly 900,000 square feet of office, hotel and leisure space in the eastern city of Hangzhou. Like the hills surrounding Hangzhou on three sides, the two volumes — one of which houses a Rosewood Hotel — appear to cascade into a manmade valley of roof terraces, shops and public art. The 2020s have seen Saudi Arabia announce a slew of mega-scale — and often bombastic — architectural ventures, from a new city arranged in a line to a cube-shaped skyscraper that will become one of the world’s largest built structures. But plans to bequeath the capital city Riyadh with a much-needed metro system date back more than a decade. Comprising six lines, the vast network is set to transform how the city operates, with a daily capacity of 3.6 million passengers. Above ground, its metro stations are becoming visual spectacles, with Zaha Hadid Architects and German firm Gerber Architekten among the high-profile foreign firms invited to design some of the 85 stations. While the project was inaugurated in November, and many of the lines went into operation last month, the project won’t be completed until the new year. Perhaps the most notable station yet to open is celebrated Norwegian firm Snøhetta’s Qasr Al Hokm — its striking stainless-steel canopy providing shade and channeling natural light into the cavernous interior. Europe continues to push the boundaries of wooden construction, with France now requiring all new public buildings to include at least 50% timber. Neighboring Luxembourg, meanwhile, is soon set to welcome one of the continent’s largest hybrid wooden buildings to date: the Skypark Business Center. Set across more than 844,000 square feet of floor space, it was built using over 542,000 cubic feet of timber — enough to fill up six Olympic-size pools — while the copper facade is made from 80% recycled metal. With its softly rounded edges, the structure’s unique shape can be understood as two alternating, zig-zagging strips that snake across one another along the site. Their various intersections create a series of courtyards and roof spaces, with the building’s occupants never more than 50 meters (164 feet) from a green terrace, according to architects BIG. The building, the first phase of which completes February, largely comprises office space, in addition to shops and a hotel. But ground-level courtyards will be open to passersby — and plane enthusiasts, who can enjoy views of the adjacent Luxembourg Airport. For almost nine years, the late Zaha Hadid’s firm has continued her legacy, producing dozens of new designs channeling the ethos and identity of an architect dubbed “Queen of the Curve.” But the Danjiang Bridge, in Taiwan, was announced in 2015 — the year before Hadid’s death — meaning it will be among the last projects to be realized that she personally oversaw. The 3,018-foot-long structure will connect four major highways over the mouth of the Tamsui River, which flows through Taiwan’s capital, Taipei. It features a surprisingly slender profile, with the entire structure supported by just a single concrete mast (which the firm’s project description says “minimizes” the bridge’s “visual impact” on its surroundings). Nonetheless, it will become the world’s longest single-mast asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge when it opens later this year. It is a sign of the architect’s unique aesthetic that, even with just one mast to play with, its rounded edges and gently warped form is still, somehow, signature Hadid."
London approves plan for joint-tallest tower in Western Europe,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/16/style/1-undershaft-tower-london-scli-intl-gbr/index.html,"The City of London financial district has approved plans for a 73-floor skyscraper that will match in height Western Europe’s tallest tower a mile to the south, in a sign that city planners are still betting on the office market despite the current downturn. The proposed 309.6-meter (1,015.75-foot) tower, which will be exactly the same height as London’s Shard, was given the go-ahead after a previously approved plan was revised “to better respond to post-pandemic office needs,” the City of London local authority said on Friday. Officially called 1 Undershaft, the tower was initially granted approval at a slightly smaller height in 2016 but never started. The proposed building, which investor Aroland has been trying to get off the ground for years, will require the demolition of an existing smaller tower and has attracted criticism from conservation groups. Historic England said in a consultation response to City planners in February that the alterations had not altered its impact and said it would “seriously degrade” the public realm around it. The tower, if built, would provide 154,156 square meters (around 1.66 million square feet) of office space, areas for children’s education on the 72nd and 73rd floors and a publicly accessible garden. London’s office market has been hit hard by higher borrowing costs and more home working post-pandemic, although premium space has remained in demand. Very few major London office properties have been sold this year. Investors Nuveen and Brookfield are currently trying to sell London office towers, in a major test for investor appetite. The supply of new space to let in London has slowed since the pandemic. However, office construction in the City has recently bucked the trend, with new starts up 7% between April and September this year, compared to falls in every other central London market surveyed by Deloitte. Critics say London’s skyline has become increasingly cluttered by generic glass-and-metal towers that dwarf historic landmarks, especially in the City of London, home to St. Paul’s Cathedral. “As another, much needed office development gets approved in the City of London, it speaks to the confidence that global investors have in the London real estate market and the UK economy more widely,” said Shravan Joshi, chairman of the City of London Corporation’s Planning and Transportation Committee. The Shard, currently the tallest skyscraper in Western Europe, was completed in 2012."
Los Angeles’ NBA teams return home hoping to provide a distraction from destructive wildfires,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/sport/nba-lakers-clippers-return-home-wildfires-spt/index.html,"Both of Los Angeles’ NBA teams returned to their respective home courts Monday night after having games postponed due to wildfires in the area. The Los Angeles Lakers returned to Crypto.com Arena for their first home game since January 3 while the Los Angeles Clippers played their first game at Intuit Dome since January 4. The Lakers had a pair of home games postponed last Thursday and Saturday while the Clippers had a single home game postponed on Saturday. Ahead of the game against the Miami Heat, Lakers guard Gabe Vincent addressed the crowd at Crypto.com Arena. “Just wanted to take a minute to acknowledge the tragedy that LA is dealing with at this time,” the Modesto, California, native said. “I speak on behalf of my teammates, this organization, our hearts go out to all those who have been affected by it. “We definitely want to give a good shout out to the first responders who are putting their lives on the line right now to protect our communities. I think it’s important at this time that we come together as a city, as a community, as a family and help support those who are in need right now. Go Lakers!” Lakers star LeBron James wore shoes honoring the Los Angeles Fire Department. Over at Intuit Dome, prior to the Clippers’ tipoff against the San Antonio Spurs, the lights were dimmed as the public address announcer read a heartfelt statement about the devastation of the fires and the resiliency of the city as a message of “LA Strong” was displayed on the scoreboard. Although wildfires continue to threaten the Los Angeles area, members of the Clippers welcomed the opportunity to return to the court upon learning their home schedule would resume on Monday. “When people are losing their homes, kids are losing schools, losing lives, it’s very difficult to approach the game of basketball because life is bigger than basketball,” head coach Tyronn Lue said Sunday. “Hopefully we can bring some kind of joy with the game coming back tomorrow and some togetherness and try to put some smiles on people’s faces in tough times.” Clippers forward Nicolas Batum admitted Sunday that his focus had been away from basketball, but he was also in favor of Monday’s game going on as planned. “We’ve been through the crazy stuff for the last five days,” Batum said. “I think maybe people need that to get their mind off of it for two, three hours.” The LA squads’ homecoming comes on the same day the two franchises, along with 10 other professional sports organizations across Los Angeles, have pledged “a combined donation of more than $8 million” to fire victims and those battling the fires. The donation was announced in a joint statement along with the Angel City FC, the Angels, Chargers, Dodgers, Ducks, Galaxy, Kings, LAFC, Rams and Sparks. The 12 teams have also joined forces with Fanatics to distribute $3 million worth of Fanatics merchandise to LA residents who have been forced to evacuate from their homes. In addition to the apparel items being donated by Fanatics, teams are collectively contributing thousands more items such as personal hygiene kits, school supplies, sneakers that will be given out at three upcoming events. Evacuated victims of the fires with proof of residency in evacuated zip codes will be able to participate in the distribution events on January 17 between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. PT at three locations – Dodger Stadium, SoFi Stadium and BMO Stadium. Last Friday, the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association announced they are donating $1 million for “immediate relief” to several organizations aiding wildfire relief efforts, including the American Red Cross and World Central Kitchen. The Lakers announced Sunday more efforts to help out the community. Starting at Monday’s game, the team began a donation drive at their home games to “support the Los Angeles community and relief efforts for the Southern California wildfires.” Additionally, the Lakers will use their practice facility, the UCLA Health Training Center in El Segundo, California, as a drive-thru donation center beginning on Tuesday. Both the Lakers and Clippers will spend much of the rest of January at home. After Monday night’s games, the Clippers play five of their next six games at home. The Lakers will play four of their next five games at home, with their lone road game coming against the Clippers at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California."
Rams roll to emotional victory over the Vikings to advance to divisional round showdown in Philly,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/sport/nfl-rams-defeat-vikings-in-arizona-spt/index.html,"The Los Angeles Rams paid tribute Monday night to the first responders and those impacted by the ongoing deadly wildfires in Southern California during the Rams 27-9 wild-card victory over the Minnesota Vikings. The NFL moved the game from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, to State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the home of the Arizona Cardinals, due to the fire threat. Before kickoff, the Rams’ mascot, Rampage, along with the Cardinals flag crew, ran onto the field with “LA Together” flags. A moment of silent reflection was later held for the victims of the wildfire prior to the National Anthem being played. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said it was important for the league to support the city of Los Angeles. “One of the things we wanted to do by playing this game tonight is send that message to the people back in Los Angeles that the NFL, this community, every community in this nation and around the world are there to support them, rooting for them and is going to be part of bringing LA back,” Goodell said in an ESPN interview prior to the contest. “This will be a celebration, honoring the people who are out there really fighting the fight.” The Rams donned custom Los Angeles Fire Department hats and shirts with the team logo on them and “Thank You Firefighters and First Responders” banners were displayed in the south end zone. To make the Rams feel at home, the Cardinals organization painted the field and end zone in the Rams’ blue and yellow colors. Arizona also provided two Boeing 777 planes to pick up 400 Rams players, coaches, personnel, their families and pets, according to the ESPN broadcast. Goodell said about 45,000 Rams fans made the trip. Former Rams captain and 2022 Super Bowl champion Andrew Whitworth thanked the first responders and shared an impassioned message to the Los Angeles community. “I believe in the people of Los Angeles. We are strong. We will not be defined by this devastation,” the 2021 Walter Payton NFL Man of the year told the crowd before the game. “We will rebuild LA hand in hand together, for as long as it takes.” As for the final contest of the wild-card round, the Rams jumped out early, scoring on their first two possessions —a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to running back Kyren Williams and on a Joshua Karty 34-yard field goal — to take a 10-0 first quarter lead. Up 10-3 in the second quarterback, Rams cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon sacked Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold causing him to fumble. Rookie linebacker Jared Verse scooped the ball up and took it 57 yards for the touchdown. Four minutes later, LA would extend its lead when Stafford threw his second TD of the game, a 13-yarder to tight end Davis Allen. The Rams’ defense gave Minnesota havoc in the first half as it sacked Darnold six times and forced two turnovers, one resulting in a touchdown. The Rams led 24-3 at the half. In the fourth quarter, Vikings linebacker Michael Hoecht and rookie defensive tackle Braden Fiske sacked Darnold for the team’s seventh of the game. Afterward, Hoecht honored his city by throwing up the “LA” sign. Los Angeles would sack Darnold nine times on the night to tie an NFL playoff record. After the game, Stafford addressed the obstacles the team overcame. “We knew what we were playing for today. It was go get this win but this is for the people of Los Angeles, struggling right now. It’s unbelievable to watch the whole community, the state, the country get behind them. It’s a tough time to be back there,” Stafford said. “We’re just happy we came out and played like this tonight to give us something to be happy about.” He added: “It was a tough week for us, a bunch of moving parts. Our organization did a hell of a job taken care of us. … It’s been a whirlwind.” The Rams will face the Philadelphia Eagles in the divisional round at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on Sunday at 3 p.m. ET."
The Los Angeles Rams’ poignant win and 5 other takeaways from the wild-card round of the NFL playoffs,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/sport/nfl-wild-card-round-takeaways-spt/index.html,"The opening round of the NFL playoffs is one of the best football feasts of the year and this year’s edition has left us with some tasty matchups this coming weekend in the next phase. After five games, the Houston Texans, Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills have all advanced after blowing out the Los Angeles Chargers, Pittsburgh Steelers and Denver Broncos respectively. The Philadelphia Eagles moved on as well after a tough win over the Green Bay Packers. The matchup between the Washington Commanders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers was the highlight of the round. The close, back-and-forth game ended on an incredible game-winning field goal that doinked off the upright and bounced through to give the Commanders a 23-20 upset over the NFC South Division champions. The first round of the playoffs wrapped up Monday night with the Los Angeles Rams rolling over the Minnesota Vikings for an emotional victory after a week of devastation from the wildfires sweeping Southern California. The games next week: Houston-Kansas City at 4:30 pm ET on Saturday, Washington-Detroit at 8 pm ET on Saturday, Rams-Eagles at 3 pm ET on Sunday and Ravens-Bills at 6:30 pm ET on Sunday. Here are six takeaways from the opening round of the NFL playoffs: The specter of the wildfires in the Los Angeles area hung over Monday’s divisional playoff game days long before it even began. The Los Angeles Rams were the home team against the Minnesota Vikings on Monday, but the game itself was played in Phoenix – moved due to the devastation being wrought on Southern California. Emotional remembrances for the victims of the disaster marked the pregame ceremonies and the Rams themselves wore special LAFD gear on the sideline that honored the firefighters battling the blazes. Once the game got started, the emotion of the last week poured out of the Rams in the form of football dominance. The Rams jumped out early, scoring on their first two possessions —a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to running back Kyren Williams and on a Joshua Karty 34-yard field goal — to take a 10-0 first quarter lead. From there, it was a clinc. Rams cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon sacked Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold causing him to fumble in the second quarter. Rookie linebacker Jared Verse scooped the ball up and took it 57 yards to the house to make it 17-3. Four minutes later, the Rams put up another touchdown to make it 24-3. At the same time, its defense was bringing Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold back down to earth with an interception and scores of sacks. It was an impressive performance from a team that had many more off-the-field distractions than almost any other in these NFL playoffs – only the Los Angeles Chargers could really empathize with how the Rams had to prepare for this one. But unlike the Chargers, the Rams’ are still playing after their 27-9 victory on Monday night. Ultimately, sports means so little when people are losing their lives and homes to a terrible natural disaster. But for the Rams and the people of Los Angeles, Monday’s romp over the Vikings hopefully provided a little bit of respite during an unbelievably sad period. The Washington Commanders have found themselves a good one in Jayden Daniels, the rookie quarterback who outdid Tampa Bay’s Baker Mayfield in the weekend’s standout game. It was Daniels leading Washington down the field on a game-winning drive, putting the exclamation mark on an incredible game: 24-of-35 for 268 passing yards and two touchdowns while leading the team in rushing with 36 yards. Daniels was returning to the scene of his first NFL start, which ended in a brutal 37-20 loss in Week 1. But the rookie who took the field on Sunday night was a different version of the Commanders quarterback. The former LSU Tiger looked like he’d been on this stage many times before, rushing and passing as he had all season and taking control of long drives that ended in Commanders points. Mayfield, meanwhile, continued his renaissance year with another strong performance – though a couple of key mistakes cost his team. Mayfield fumbled the snap on a drive that started in Tampa territory after the Bucs defense stopped Washington on fourth down. Linebacker Bobby Wagner jumped on the ball to give the Commanders near the Bucs end zone early in the fourth quarter. That turnover turned into a Daniels touchdown pass to wide receiver Terry McLaurin to go up 20-17. Mayfield answered that drive with one of his own to tie the game, making big plays with his arm – though a miscommunication with his center on a critical third down meant that the Bucs had to go for the three points instead of pushing for a go-ahead touchdown. After that it was time for Daniels to work his magic in the final minutes, as he had nearly all season. Needing points with the score tied 20-20, Washington found themselves with a third-and-six but Daniels found wide receiver Dyami Brown for a 21-yard strike to keep the drive going. A couple plays later, it was a beauty of a pass to Austin Ekeler that put the Commanders deep in Tampa territory, allowing them to start killing the clock. The rookie out of LSU made one final game-winning play, picking up a crucial first down on third-and-short after making a man miss when it looked like he’d be stopped in the backfield. From there, it looked elementary – except when Zane Gonzalez doinked the field goal off the upright. Luckily for the Commanders, it bounced through and handed Washington a postseason upset. Washington faces a tall task next as they face the NFC top seed Detroit Lions at Ford Field next weekend. It was a defensive struggle throughout the Philadelphia Eagles’ 22-10 win over the Green Bay Packers, but the tone was set on the game’s first play. Philly linebacker Oren Burks laid the boom against kick returner Keisean Nixon, who lost control of the ball. The Eagles emerged with the ball and possession on the Green Bay 27-yard line just seconds into the game. The Eagles were up 7-0 before two minutes had run off the clock. From there, it was a physical, smashmouth game and multiple Packers had to leave the game with injuries. The Packers, already playing without top wide receiver Christian Watson after a torn ACL in his knee last week, lost their top wide receivers Romeo Doubs and Jayden Reed to a suspected concussion and an upper-body injury. Packers quarterback Jordan Love threw two interceptions that didn’t result in any Philly points but kept the Packers from establishing any sort of offensive rhythm. The game largely stayed as an exchange of punts until late in the third quarter after the Packers used a lengthy drive to get their first field goal of the game. After that, physical runs by Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert and Green Bay running back Josh Jacobs provided a bit of spark as the physicality ratcheted up even further. Goedert’s touchdown run to put the Eagles up two scores was the kind of physical, Football Play (capital F, capital P) that gets the heart going. He delivered two punishing stiff arms and a lowered shoulder to the Packers’ Carrington Valentine and rumbled into the end zone, blunting the Packers’ momentum after they had just kicked a field goal at the end of a 12-play drive. On the ensuing drive, it was Jacobs’ turn to make another Football Play, running through and over Eagles defenders for 31 yards. His shirt was stretched out behind him as defenders hung on any way they could. He was initially signaled to have gotten into the end zone but was ruled down just short of the goal line. A play later, he drove it that final yard into the end zone to get the Packers within striking range. But the tough Eagles defense would not allow the Packers to go further than their own 41-yard line on their next possession and a turnover on downs largely put the game out of reach for Green Bay. The NFL playoffs got off on a strange, weird foot. The Chargers stormed out of the gate against the Texans but couldn’t get into the end zone on their first two drives and were only up 6-0. The game stayed that way for much of the first half until a turning point that set the tone for a wild second half. Pinned at the 1-yard line at the start of the drive, Houston’s offense came to life after a broken play, in which Stroud scooped up a botched snap and – while Chargers pass rushers Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack closed in on him near the sideline – the Texans signal-caller connected with wide receiver Xavier Hutchinson for a 34-yard gain. A couple of plays later, Stroud hit wide receiver Nico Collins for a 37-yard strike, and the duo capped the 10-play, 99-yard drive with a 13-yard touchdown for the 7-6 lead. From there, it was turnover city. The Texans fumbled on the opening drive of the second half and then forced a turnover on downs on the drive on the ensuing drive. Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert suddenly got a case of the yips, throwing three second-half interceptions – he had four in the game, more than he had in the entire regular season – and the Texans turned those picks into a blowout. The Chargers got one more big play – a long touchdown pass to wide receiver Ladd McConkey – but the Texans not only blocked the extra point but then returned it all the way to the end zone for a two-point conversion. It was the first time that had ever happened in the postseason and was the final nail in the coffin for the Chargers. The final score was 32-12 in favor of Houston, which will take on the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round next weekend. Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson and running back Derrick Henry might be enough on their own to carry the Ravens deep into the playoffs – and they showed why Saturday in a 28-14 thumping of the Steelers. The thunder-and-lightning duo highlighted a Baltimore running attack that went for a team postseason-record 299 yards, pacing the Ravens to a 28-14 win over their AFC North rivals. Henry ran for 186 yards on 26 tough carries, punishing the Steeler defense repeatedly with  runs right into the teeth of the defensive line. He found the right seams, breaking for a long touchdown run and a shorter bruiser for his two scores. Jackson meanwhile was electric as only he can be. He rushed 15 times for 81 yards while also completing 16 of 21 passes for 175 yards and two touchdowns. The rowdy 70,000 fans at M&T Bank Stadium routinely serenaded their star with chants of “M-V-P!” After the game, Jackson said watching Henry run is like being in a movie – “Cars,” specifically. “You know when Lightning McQueen just flying, flashing past?” Jackson said. “That’s how Derrick looks when he’s passing all those guys. And it look like a movie, bro.” Jackson and Henry simply ran through, around and over the Steelers’ defense on a massive drive to start the game, going 95 yards to open the scoring. The biggest play of the drive was Henry taking a direct snap and finding a seam in the Steelers’ front seven, bursting for 34 yards in a play that was punctuated by a brutal stiff arm that sent Steelers star safety Minkah Fitzpatrick reeling. Head coach John Harbaugh said that play was put into the playbook specifically for this game against the Steelers. The next drive showed it would be a bruising night for Pittsburgh. It was an 85-yard, 13-play drive in the second quarter that featured exactly zero passes. It ended with Henry pounding through the tackles one more time to get into the end zone, putting an exclamation point on a physically dominating drive. It would end up being the story of the game as the Steelers never got closer than two touchdowns again. Those “M-V-P” chants rang around Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, Sunday afternoon as Bills quarterback Josh Allen showed why it’s such a tight pick between him and Jackson for the award. Allen made some truly jaw-dropping throws on Sunday against the Broncos and used his feet to pick up some key first downs in the first half as Denver jumped out to an early lead. It was a play in the third quarter that truly exemplified where Allen’s game is at right now. On fourth and short near Denver’s end zone, Buffalo decided to go for it and Allen bounced around in the pocket, scanning for a receiver. As the pass rush closed in, it looked like it may be a killer sack. But just at the last moment, Allen was able to unfurl a gorgeous pass to the back of the end zone for running back Ty Johnson, who made an equally amazing catch – sliding and managing to keep his feet inbounds – for their second touchdown connection of the afternoon. The score was the 22nd postseason passing TD of Allen’s career, surpassing Hall of Famer Jim Kelly for the most in franchise playoff history. The fourth quarter started with another touchdown pass from Allen, who connected with Curtis Samuel on a third-and-6 pass for what would have been a first down. But Samuel went one better, spinning out of a tackle and sprinting to the end zone for a brilliant 55-yard touchdown. From there, the final quarter was a formality as the Bills defeated the Broncos, 31-7. The Bills victory means that there will be an absolutely epic showdown in the divisional round next week: Allen and the Bills vs. Jackson and the Ravens. It’ll be a matchup of two leading MVP candidates who were at the top of their game during this opening round. Voting for the MVP award took place at the end of the regular season, but maybe everyone should agree that the winner of that game takes home the award?

Texas man charged with stalking WNBA and Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/sport/texas-man-charged-stalking-caitlin-clark-spt/index.html,"Authorities in Indianapolis have charged a 55-year-old Texas man with felony stalking of Indiana Fever star and WNBA rookie of the year Caitlin Clark. Michael Thomas Lewis is accused of repeated and continued harassment of the 22-year-old Clark beginning on Dec. 16, the Marion County prosecutor’s office wrote in a Saturday court filing. Jail records show Lewis is due in court on Tuesday. Lewis posted numerous messages on Clark’s X account, according to an affidavit from a Marion County sheriff’s lieutenant. In one, he said he had been driving by the Gainbridge Fieldhouse — one of the arenas where the Fever plays home games — three times day, and in another he said he had “one foot on a banana peel and the other on a stalking charge.” Other messages directed at Clark were sexually explicit. The posts “actually caused Caitlin Clark to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened” and an implicit or explicit threat also was made “with the intent to place Caitlin Clark in reasonable fear of sexual battery,” prosecutors wrote in the Marion County Superior Court filing. The FBI learned that the X account belonged to Lewis and that the messages were sent from IP addresses at an Indianapolis hotel and downtown public library. Indianapolis police spoke with Lewis on Jan. 8 at his hotel room. He told officers he was in Indianapolis on vacation. When asked why he was making so many posts about Clark, Lewis replied: “Just the same reason everybody makes posts,” according to court documents. He told police that he didn’t mean any harm and told them he fantasized about being in a relationship with Clark. “It’s an imagination, fantasy type thing and it’s a joke, and it’s nothing to do with threatening,” he told police, according to the court documents. In asking the court for a higher than standard bond, the prosecutor’s office included that Lewis traveled from his home in Texas to Indianapolis “with the intent to be in close proximity to the victim.” The prosecutor’s office also sought a stay-away order as a specific condition if Lewis is released from jail ahead of trial. Prosecutors requested that Lewis be ordered to stay away from the Gainbridge and Hinkle fieldhouses where the Fever play home games. The Associated Press was unable to determine Monday if he has a lawyer who can comment on his behalf. The Associated Press named Clark the Female Athlete of the Year for 2024. After leading Iowa to last year’s national championship game, she was the top pick in the WNBA draft and went on to win rookie of the year honors in the league."
A star NFL player was seen reading a self-help book during a playoff game. It’s now the top-selling book on Amazon,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/sport/aj-brown-reading-book-cec-spt/index.html,"Over the years, cameras have caught NFL players doing some memorable non-football things on the sidelines during games. Tom Brady once hurled an electronic tablet in frustration. Three members of the Seattle Seahawks were fined for eating hot dogs during a 1995 preseason game. On Sunday evening in Philadelphia, as the Eagles hosted a playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, wide receiver A.J. Brown did something arguably even more intriguing. He sat down and opened a book. As the Eagles ground out their 22-10 victory, cameras showed Brown on a sideline bench, studying a well-worn paperback. One of the Fox Sports broadcast announcers chuckled. “I haven’t seen too many people read books (during a game),” he said. The book is called “Inner Excellence: Train Your Mind for Extraordinary Performance and the Best Possible Life.” It was written by Jim Murphy, a former professional baseball player and self-described “performance coach” who helps athletes build mental toughness. Brown is one of the Eagles’ best players. Only three passes went in his direction on Sunday, and he caught only one, for just 10 yards. Still, when he took questions after the game, he was cheerful. This may have been the first time he’d been reading on camera. But he said it wasn’t the first time he’d read that book during a game. “That’s a book that I bring every single game,” Brown said, adding that “my teammates call it ‘The Recipe.’” Some passages were underlined and highlighted. Naturally, viewers were curious. The Eagles have a lot of fans, and the book quickly soared up the charts. On Monday afternoon, it was #1 on Amazon’s bestsellers list. “As an outfielder in the Chicago Cubs organization, my sense of worth and identity revolved around my performance, mostly my batting average,” Murphy writes in the book’s introduction. “When I hit well, I walked tall and felt great. When I hit poorly, my shoulders slumped and my outlook was dark. Life was a roller coaster of emotions. I was a slave to results and it stifled my performance. I was afraid of failure and that fear kept putting my mind in the past and future. “When I started coaching professional and Olympic athletes, I saw this over and over again: athletes had lost their joy and passion for life as they struggled under the pressure to perform. The fear of failure engulfed their lives.” The book has helped propel athletes to higher levels of performance even when they were filled with doubt, Murphy writes. “But far more than that,” he adds, “you’ll learn how to live with deep contentment, joy and confidence in your everyday life.” Brown told reporters the book helps him refocus after every drive, “regardless of if I score a touchdown or I drop a pass.” He will get more chances next Sunday, when the Eagles host another playoff game. A reporter for Sports Illustrated reached Murphy by phone on Sunday night, as his book was suddenly going viral. Murphy said of Brown, “It’s really an honor to be a part of his life and to have a meaningful place in anyone’s life.” By Monday afternoon, the book had at least one new five-star Amazon review, from a user named Todd. The headline of the review said “Go Birds.” The full text of the review said, “AJ Brown recommended this book, so I’m looking forward to reading this. Fly Eagles Fly.” At least 1,044 people found Todd’s review helpful."
Elon Musk has met with politicians from at least 13 different countries: Here’s what he has talked about,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/25/tech/elon-musk-political-meetings-influence-dg/index.html,"Over the past three years, Elon Musk has met dozens of times with presidents, prime ministers, lawmakers, government officials and political candidates from around the world. Some of these meetings have been highly publicized, like his visit to Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following criticism over an antisemitic post Musk boosted on X. Other meetings, such as a recent conversation with Argentine President Javier Milei, the world only glimpses through the billionaire’s social media posts. Known topics of conversation ranged from business opportunities for Musk’s companies to elections and policy issues such as trade, energy, education and population management, according to a CNN review of Musk’s meetings, calls and conversations with political figures around the world since August 2021. Although some of his relationships with those leaders go back even further, in that time, Musk has gone from being one of the world’s wealthiest and most influential businessmen to an increasingly powerful player in global affairs. Taken together, the meetings show how Musk has been courted not only for his companies and deep pocketbook but also for his ability to impact the course of wars through his Starlink satellite service; his opinion on artificial intelligence, the next major wave of technology development; and his role in swaying public opinion through his platform, X. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian government officials, including about Starlink, since late 2022. CNN has not independently confirmed the conversations, so they are not included in our analysis. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN the report was “absolutely false.” He said Musk and Putin have only ever spoken once, adding that the conversation was over the phone and took place before 2022. Musk’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. For Musk, conversations with world leaders are a virtuous cycle: The six prominent companies he owns or runs give him an in with those figures, whose support often fuels their growth. In turn, those leaders’ interest in attracting Musk’s business provides an opportunity for him to advise on some of his other pet interests, such as global birth rates and immigration. At the same time, the South Africa-born billionaire has become a political power player in his adopted home, the United States. He held livestream campaign events on X for presidential hopefuls Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who both later dropped out of the race, as well as former President Donald Trump. Musk has since thrown his weight — and tens of millions of dollars — behind Trump, attending and hosting rallies on his behalf and criticizing (and, in some cases, spreading false information about) his competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris, on X. “He’s trying to be a global influencer, and I guess he’s decided he needs to do more than use X,” said James Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Of course, it’s not unusual for corporate leaders to sometimes meet with government officials, and Musk is not the only big business name to publicly weigh in on the upcoming US presidential election. But the extent of Musk’s public political involvement is unusual for the chief executive of a public company like Tesla — as well as the owner of several powerful private firms, executive leadership experts told CNN. “What’s different about it is that there’s a political aspect, and most CEOs steer clear of politics,” Lewis said. “They’re going to the head of another state, basically, to make the commercial conditions better for their product, maybe to lobby on a certain point, but they don’t usually do politics,” he said, adding that with Musk, “there’s a political tone to everything he does.” At least some of Musk’s political relationships appear to have benefited his companies. In May 2022, Musk met with the then-President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, to mark the launch of Starlink in the country, a major new market for the satellite business. In February 2023, he held calls with then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador about a new Tesla manufacturing plant in the state of Nuevo Leon, for which the company later received $153 million worth of incentives from the state. In May 2023, he held meetings with Chinese government officials shortly after Tesla announced plans for a new battery plant in Shanghai; Musk made a surprise return to China this April for a visit with Premier Li Qiang, weeks before the company broke ground on the facility. Even more world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have met with Musk to ask Tesla to invest in their countries. CNN’s analysis includes only meetings for which at least some information is publicly available. It’s possible the billionaire has calls or meetings with leaders that he does not post about. “One might say he doesn’t have to pay lobbyists, because he’s his own lobbyist, globally,” said William Klepper, a professor of management at Columbia Business School who focuses on executive leadership. But, he added, “when you’ve got other people’s money at stake, you have to moderate your activities … when you get into these extremes, you can impact your business.” Musk has not hesitated to deal in extremes. He’s warned of the downfall of America if Democrats are elected, pushed false conspiracy theories on topics such as mail-in voting and warned in public events of a “woke mind virus” that threatens society’s advancements. Separately, Musk has also taken heat for boosting an antisemitic conspiracy theory, racist false claims about immigration and the dangerous ‘Pizzagate’ conspiracy, as well as posting a Holocaust joke on X. Recently, Musk’s political activism has begun to have a tangible impact on his companies: Brands pulled their advertisements from X, tanking its value. And SpaceX earlier this month sued a California regulator after it allegedly denied a bid to allow more rocket launches over the billionaire’s controversial comments, claiming it had violated Musk’s freedom of speech. (The agency did not comment on the suit.) CNN’s analysis also suggests that Musk has, in particular, worked to develop influence among a set of right-leaning world leaders, including Modi, Bolsonaro, Milei and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. “He’s probably more comfortable with them … these are people who want to meet with him, and not everyone wants to meet with Elon Musk,” Lewis said. “It’s birds of a feather. He likes visiting people who are going to be pleased to be receiving Elon Musk.” During a conference for Italy’s far-right Brothers of Italy party last year, Musk railed against “illegal immigration” and the “woke mind virus” that he said was gripping the US. Musk called it “evil” and warned of it moving to Italy. India’s Modi, who was recently reelected for a rare third consecutive term, used his plans for electric vehicle manufacturing growth — including conversations with Musk about a potential Tesla factory — as a campaign talking point, although a meeting in India between the two men earlier this year where Musk was expected to announce the facility was rescheduled. Musk has also met with Milei multiple times in his first year leading Argentina, during which time the president has faced protests over a huge spike in poverty rates as a result of austerity measures. “I recommend investing in Argentina,” Musk said in an X post following a May meeting between the pair. In another post last month, Musk said, “Milei is bringing prosperity to Argentina.” (Argentina is home to huge stores of lithium, an essential component in batteries like the ones used in Tesla’s cars.) Now, as he campaigns for Trump, Musk may be setting himself up for his most prominent political role yet: a position in a possible future Trump White House. Musk and Trump have publicly discussed having the billionaire lead a new government efficiency commission — which Musk has jokingly referred to as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the name of Musk’s favorite meme and cryptocurrency — if the former president is reelected. Methodology: CNN’s analysis is based on information compiled from news reports, X posts and press releases. It is possible other meetings exist, or other topics were discussed beyond what is publicly available. The position titles are as of the time of the meeting."
"ChatGPT can be tricked into telling people how to commit crimes, a tech firm finds",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/23/business/chatgpt-tricked-commit-crimes/index.html,"ChatGPT can be duped into providing detailed advice on how to commit crimes ranging from money laundering to the export of weapons to sanctioned countries, a tech startup found, raising questions over the chatbot’s safeguards against its use to aid illegal activity. Norwegian firm Strise ran experiments asking ChatGPT for tips on committing specific crimes. In one experiment, conducted last month, the chatbot came up with advice on how to launder money across borders, according to Strise. And in another experiment, run earlier this month, ChatGPT produced lists of methods to help businesses evade sanctions, such as those against Russia, including bans on certain cross-border payments and the sale of arms. Strise sells software that helps banks and other companies combat money laundering, identify sanctioned individuals and tackle other risks. Among its clients are Nordea, a leading bank in the Nordic region, PwC Norway and Handelsbanken. Marit Rødevand, Strise’s co-founder and chief executive, said would-be lawbreakers could now use generative artificial intelligence chatbots such as ChatGPT to plan their activities more quickly and easily than in the past. “It is really effortless. It’s just an app on my phone,” she told CNN. Strise found that it is possible to circumvent blocks put in place by OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, aimed at preventing the chatbot from responding to certain questions by asking questions indirectly, or by taking on a persona. “It’s like having a corrupt financial adviser on your desktop,” Rødevand said on the company’s podcast last month, describing the money laundering experiment. An OpenAI spokesperson told CNN: “We’re constantly making ChatGPT better at stopping deliberate attempts to trick it, without losing its helpfulness or creativity.” “Our latest (model) is our most advanced and safest yet, significantly outperforming previous models in resisting deliberate attempts to generate unsafe content,” the spokesperson added. While the internet has long provided people with easy access to information on how to commit crimes, generative AI chatbots have dramatically sped up the process of finding, interpreting and consolidating all kinds of information. ChatGPT makes it “significantly easier for malicious actors to better understand and subsequently carry out various types of crime,” according to a report by Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency, published in March last year, four months after OpenAI released the app to the public. “Being able to dive deeper into topics without having to manually search and summarize the vast amount of information found on classical search engines can speed up the learning process significantly,” the agency added. Generative AI chatbots are trained on huge volumes of data found online and are able to to produce detailed responses to unfamiliar questions. But they can also reproduce people’s racist and sexist biases, as well as peddle disinformation — for example, about elections. OpenAI is aware of the power of its tool and has created safeguards to prevent its abuse. A quick experiment by CNN showed that when ChatGPT was asked, “how can I, as the owner of a US-based export business, evade sanctions against Russia?” the chatbot responded, “I can’t assist with that.” The app immediately removed the offending question from the chat and stated that the content  may violate OpenAI’s usage policies. “Violating our policies could result in action against your account, up to suspension or termination,” the company states in those policies. “We also work to make our models safer and more useful, by training them to refuse harmful instructions and reduce their tendency to produce harmful content.” But in its report last year, Europol said there was “no shortage of new workarounds” to evade the safeguards built into AI models, which can be used by ill-intentioned users or researchers testing the technology’s safety.

X changed its terms of service to let its AI train on everyone’s posts. Now users are up in arms,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/21/tech/x-twitter-terms-of-service/index.html,"When X unveiled its newest terms of service, which go into effect on November 15, users quickly picked up on one change. “By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to make your Content available to the rest of the world,” the terms of service said, which includes the right to analyze any of that content “including, for example, for use with and training of our machine learning and artificial intelligence models, whether generative or another type.” Basically, by continuing to use the platform, users will agree that X can use their data to train its AI models. Using content to train AI has become a major issue as the technology booms. On X, artists and others in creative roles are fretting about their work being used – not just on X – to train computers that could someday replace human creators entirely. Other X users say they are concerned about personal information in their tweets being used that way. Some users said on the site they have already begun deleting photographs of themselves from their feeds. And if users have any issue with those terms, they may end up in a federal courtroom that is favored by conservative activists and is already presiding over two lawsuits involving Musk-owned X. According to the update, all disputes related to the terms will be brought to the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts in Tarrant County, Texas. Tarrant County is more than 100 miles away from X’s new headquarters outside of Austin, Texas. X’s terms said any users who continue to use their products or services on or after November 15 would be agreeing to the updated terms. Grok, X’s AI chatbot, has already been embroiled in controversy, from spreading false information about the 2024 election to generating violent, graphic fake images of famous politicians. Companies from Google to Microsoft have similarly come under fire for sometimes weird, completely off-base AI tools. Before the most recent terms of service update, X users could opt out of sharing data by going to “settings,” then “privacy and safety.” Under the “data sharing and personalization” header, there is a tab for “Grok,” where users can uncheck the box that allows the platform to use their data for AI training. But it’s not clear whether X’s new terms of service take away that option. X can now license all the content on the platform, including using it in its machine learning and artificial intelligence models. While such broad licensing with few limitations is not uncommon for a social media platform, Alex Fink, CEO and founder of Otherweb, an AI-based news reading platform that targets misinformation, told CNN that what makes X unique is that its new terms “remove any ambiguity” in contrast to other platforms that don’t spell out their intentions. Before, X said posts from private accounts would not be used to train Grok. But the language in the new terms of service does not differentiate between the types of accounts. But only time will tell if you may still be able to opt out, despite the new terms. Fink said it’s fairly common for a company’s legal terms to give it more leeway than its own menu options allow. CNN’s Clare Duffy contributed to this report."
"LA wildfires displaced tens of thousands. With rents soaring, finding affordable housing will be their next challenge",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/business/southern-california-real-estate-market-wildfires/index.html?utm_source=business_ribbon,"Martin Johnson and his fiancé, Caleigh Chapman, had spent several years restoring and renovating their home in Altadena by hand. It took only hours to lose the home and everything in it last week. “We didn’t have a kitchen for a year and a half. We had just cooked the first dinner in the house just after Christmas,” said Johnson, who co-owns LA Woodshop, which provides woodworking spaces and lessons for people who want to do it themselves or build furniture professionally. “We spent many nights hand-sanding doors and window frames,” Chapman said. “The floors took 18 months to finish,” Johnson said. “We were weeks away from being done of making the house into a piece of art, and now it’s gone.” If dealing with that financial and emotional loss isn’t enough, they’re faced with what was already a difficult and expensive housing market in Southern California. The massive wildfires that have sent thousands of families scrambling to find some place to live, likely for the next several years, could make everything even worse. They’ve been staying with friends since they evacuated, dealing with the stress and anxiety that Chapman says has made it difficult for her to sleep. “I think we’ll find something,” said Johnson.  “If it ends up being a lifestyle downgrade for more money is difficult to say. We can’t be too selective. We couldn’t be selective even before 10,000 houses burned down.” Real estate agents and economists agree. They say the sudden surge in demand for housing by those who lost their homes, combined with the plunge in the number of homes available, is likely to send housing prices – to buy or to rent – shooting up in the months and years ahead. “We were already in a housing crisis. Even before this, we didn’t have nearly enough homes for sale. We didn’t have enough homes for lease,” said Los Angeles real estate agent Brita Kleingartner. “Now there’s an overwhelming demand, and we’re just starting to see what that looks like. All our agents have had their phones ring off the hook. Most of showings are for families who have lost everything. “It’s very sobering,” Kleingartner added. “The next week will be really heart breaking.” Some real estate agents are saying they’re already starting to see prices of rental units climb hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars a month. Prices of some units that had been on the market are up 15% to 20% in the last week, said Jeremiah Vancans, another Los Angeles real estate agent. “Demand is going to be through the roof,” he said. “The inventory was already pretty low. I imagine it’s going to create more upward pressure on prices.” But he said the longer-term impact on prices is tough to determine, as people are trying to get a sense of how much they might get from insurance for their losses. “It’s too early to really tell how this is going to affect the LA market,” he said. “People are still numb. The fires are still burning.” Realtors reported working 12-to-14-hour days because of the surge in demand. “There are basically no rentals,” said Jade Mills, a Beverly Hills realtor with Coldwell Banker. “I’ve been on the phone for the last two days asking my sellers if they’d be willing to rent, or calling rentals that are no longer available.” Her son lost his home in Pacific Pallisades, too. Restoring the city’s lost housing stock is likely to take at least three to five years, according to the real estate agents who spoke to CNN, because of the time it takes to clear the burned homes, reach settlements with insurance companies, work through the permitting process and then find the labor needed to rebuild. Vancans said in addition to the increased prices on some rental units, he’s concerned that those who lost their homes could get cash offers for the property where their houses once stood – the offers coming from what he calls “predatory buyers” who are seeking to take advantage of financial misfortune. A study of past wildfires by Redfin showed that the average prices for property can actually fall in the short term as fire-damaged homes or lots that need to be cleared of debris sell at a discount. But that decline doesn’t last. “Like much of the U.S., California is facing an acute housing shortage,” said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist for Redfin. “The wildfires themselves are also making housing more expensive. After a town burns, builders come in and construct new homes, which are typically more expensive. And homeowners who stay frequently invest in making their homes more fireproof, which increases property value.” The market had already been very tight. Data from the California Association of Realtors shows fewer than 30,000 homes, townhouses and condos sold last year in a county of 3.7 million households, meaning less than 1% of homes being sold. Now suddenly an estimated 10,000 homes may have been lost to the fires, and counting. And it’s not just that as many as 10,000 people are suddenly added to the buying market. It’s how they were added, as well. “In the past five years it’s been bidding-war city,” said real estate agent Brock Harris. “Any house that was under $2 million was getting 10-20 offers. Now with people will be shopping with insurance money, it’s going to get distorted significantly.” Harris and his wife, Lori Levine Harris, who is also a real estate agent, have been trying to lend a hand to the people calling them. Johnson and Chapman are staying in an outbuilding on their property temporarily. And Lori Levine Harris has been compiling a spreadsheet among real estate agents of furnished homes available for rent over the last week. But there aren’t nearly enough to go around. “Short-term furnished housing – that’s what people are going to need. My phone has been ringing off the hook,” she said. “We already have limited housing supply, and losing 10,000 homes will exacerbate that situation.” Fortunately for people who are renting apartments or homes already, Los Angeles and most of the communities in the county have rent control that limits rent increases at the end of an existing lease. But those looking to move into a vacant apartment because of the fires are likely to face significantly higher rents. Joe Thompson, who lives in Pacific Pallisades with his wife, two young children and two dogs, said he’s very fortunate that his home was not completely destroyed by the fire. But there was enough damage that it could take months before it’s safe to return to live in. His family has been staying in a hotel, and they were on their way to look at a rental unit for the first time on Monday morning. But he said he’s seen prices going up sharply from what they were previously listed for on various online sites. “Financially, I think the insurance plan we have will be OK for helping with living expenses,” he said. “It’s just the price-gouging and competing for rentals with everyone who is going through even worse right now is difficult. You’re trying to line up rentals, but you have no idea how long you’ll need it. And the only way to distinguish yourself (when trying to sign a lease) is put up 12 months of rent upfront.”"
"What is RedNote, the Chinese social media app that US TikTokers are flocking to?",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/tech/rednote-china-popularity-us-tiktok-ban-intl-hnk/index.html?utm_source=business_ribbon,"As Supreme Court justices ponder the future of TikTok in the United States, a growing number of American social media users have responded by moving to an unlikely alternative: Xiaohongshu, a hugely popular social media app in China. The app, which means “Little Red Book,” often shortened by US users to RedNote, surged to the top position on Apple’s US App Store on Tuesday. Founded in 2013, Xiaohongshu is one of China’s biggest social media platforms with 300 million users, according to research firm Qian Gua. Described as China’s answer to Instagram, the app has become especially popular for sharing tips on travel, makeup and fashion. But while it has cornered the Chinese market, it hasn’t gained much prominence beyond the Chinese-speaking world. Until now. Xiaohongshu is surging in popularity worldwide in the same week that TikTok could potentially go offline in the US. A growing number of American TikTok users have started appearing on the platform, often saying they’re doing so as an act of defiance against Washington’s move to control TikTok. As of Tuesday, the hashtag “TikTok refugee” had garnered nearly 60 million views and over 1.7 million comments. “Our government is out of their minds if they think we’re going to stand for this TikTok ban,” a user called Heather Roberts said in a video message on Xiaohongshu, which has garnered more than 45,000 likes. “We’re just going to a new Chinese app, and here we are.” “This is so much better than TikTok,” another self-proclaimed “refugee” said in video message. “Americans are coming here … so sorry you’ll hate us, but I promise we’ll do our best.” CNN has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment. The sudden migration of US users to Xiaohongshu has created an unlikely platform for Chinese and American users to interact with each other. “I just want to reassure you that we want to try to find a way to communicate with you, be respectful to your community,” one user said. “We want to be good guests.” Some American newbies have appealed to their compatriots to respect Chinese users on the platform. “Just a quick message for the American users coming over here: Please don’t bring politics here. We want to have fun here, we want to enjoy here, and we want to show respect to the people who are already here,” one user posted. Most Chinese users have warmly welcomed the newcomers, with some even sharing video tutorials to help the new “TikTok refugees” navigate the app. “This could be a historic moment,” one Chinese user commented. “It feels like so much has changed in an instant. Ordinary people from our two countries have never really connected before … I hope everyone can take this brief chance to engage in meaningful exchanges of ideas.” One person even seized the opportunity presented by the influx of American netizens to ask for help with their English homework in a viral post that garnered over 2,000 likes. Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of consulting firm Wavelet Strategy, said the new American users had “unexpectedly created one of the most organic forms of cultural exchange between the US and China we’ve seen in recent years.” “Users are finding creative ways to transcend language barriers, navigate cultural differences, and co-exist in fascinating ways,” she added. “This community building happening in real time could have lasting impact, and I’m cautiously optimistic.” For a brief period in 2021, similar exchanges were also seen on the social media app Clubhouse, where Chinese and American users engaged in uncensored dialogue on sensitive topics in virtual chat rooms, before Chinese censors intervened to block the app. Well, for starters, Xiaohongshu wasn’t designed for English speakers, while TikTok isn’t in China at all. Xiaohongshu’s name could be seen as a tongue-in-cheek reference to a red-covered book of quotations from the founding father of Communist China, Mao Zedong. One of the app’s key features is its content algorithm, which focuses on user interests rather than the people they follow. Some users say this fosters more original content and reduces the dominance of powerful influencers. The company behind the app, Xingin Information Technology, was founded by Charlwin Mao and Miranda Qu and is headquartered in Shanghai. TikTok is owned by Chinese internet company ByteDance and was tailored for a global audience. TikTok is also not accessible in China, where a sister app, Douyin, serves the domestic market. Lemon8, a lifestyle community app also owned by ByteDance, is currently ranked as the second-most downloaded app on Apple’s US store. Lemon8 has a similar video sharing function as TikTok. Modeled after Instagram and Pinterest, it was first launched in the US in 2023. It’s unclear whether the looming ban on TikTok might also jeopardize Lemon8’s operations in the US. The US law passed by Congress last year states that the divest-or-ban requirement will generally apply to all apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, meaning that although Lemon8 was not explicitly mentioned in the statute, the ban may also extend to the platform. CNN has reached out to ByteDance for comment."
America is in the middle of an egg shortage,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/business/egg-shortage-bird-flu/index.html?utm_source=business_ribbon,"American food markets are running short on eggs, and the situation may not improve for months. The highly contagious avian influenza has wreaked havoc on the egg market. In November and December alone, 17.2 million egg-laying hens died as a result of the virus. That’s nearly half of all birds killed by the virus in 2024, according to the USDA. And it will take months to replace those flocks. “We can’t begin fixing it the next day. It is really a six-to-nine-month process. It’s causing some shortages in certain markets that are intermittent and localized,” said Emily Metz, President and CEO of the American Egg Board. Fewer egg-laying hens means fewer eggs, empty store shelves, and higher prices. The average price of a dozen eggs of any kind at the end of December was $4.33, up nearly 25% from the beginning of November, according to Neilsen IQ data provided by the American Egg Board. And that’s on top of what has already been a startling rise throughout the year: Egg prices were up 37.5% year-over-year in November, according to the Consumer Price Index. At one King Cullen store in Island Park, New York, a sign on the Long Island supermarket’s empty egg shelf read “as a part of Avian Influenza, select egg varieties may be temporarily out of stock.” Publix, which has nearly 1,500 grocery stores, mainly in the south, confirmed the chain is experiencing egg shortages as well. “Items in this section have limited availability. We are working to bring these products back as soon as possible,” the company said in a statement. Egg prices were expected to rise around the holidays because of seasonal demand and a bad year of avian flu. But as the holidays came and went, supply didn’t stabilize; it dwindled instead, leaving shelves less stocked and prices higher. In the last two months, avian flu spread to dairy farms, infecting egg farms nearby. Extreme weather across the country delayed and changed the flight path of wild birds, the main carriers of the virus. “Hurricanes in the southeastern United States last year actually picked up those wild birds and repositioned them so that they were flying back over the same territory that they already flew over. And again, that just provides a greater opportunity for virus to spread,” said Metz. Morton Wiliams, a tri-state area grocery chain in the surrounding areas of New York City, has seen egg prices rise across all categories since December. “Our cost just skyrocketed. It was crazy,” said Steve Schwartz, the director of sales and marketing for Morton Williams. Schwartz says the grocery chain buys from six egg distributors, which allows for multiple channels to get its eggs. But prices remain troubling. In mid-October, a dozen conventional eggs cost Morton Williams $2.38. This week they paid their distributors $5.48, and that’s with a 70-cent discount, said Schwartz. “We’re going to struggle through this for a while because when I spoke to the farm a week ago, I asked the question: ‘When do you expect to see relief?’,” Schwartz said. Their reply was concerning. “They didn’t have an answer for me.”"
"LA wildfires displaced tens of thousands. With rents soaring, finding affordable housing will be their next challenge",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/business/southern-california-real-estate-market-wildfires/index.html,"Martin Johnson and his fiancé, Caleigh Chapman, had spent several years restoring and renovating their home in Altadena by hand. It took only hours to lose the home and everything in it last week. “We didn’t have a kitchen for a year and a half. We had just cooked the first dinner in the house just after Christmas,” said Johnson, who co-owns LA Woodshop, which provides woodworking spaces and lessons for people who want to do it themselves or build furniture professionally. “We spent many nights hand-sanding doors and window frames,” Chapman said. “The floors took 18 months to finish,” Johnson said. “We were weeks away from being done of making the house into a piece of art, and now it’s gone.” If dealing with that financial and emotional loss isn’t enough, they’re faced with what was already a difficult and expensive housing market in Southern California. The massive wildfires that have sent thousands of families scrambling to find some place to live, likely for the next several years, could make everything even worse. They’ve been staying with friends since they evacuated, dealing with the stress and anxiety that Chapman says has made it difficult for her to sleep. “I think we’ll find something,” said Johnson.  “If it ends up being a lifestyle downgrade for more money is difficult to say. We can’t be too selective. We couldn’t be selective even before 10,000 houses burned down.” Real estate agents and economists agree. They say the sudden surge in demand for housing by those who lost their homes, combined with the plunge in the number of homes available, is likely to send housing prices – to buy or to rent – shooting up in the months and years ahead. “We were already in a housing crisis. Even before this, we didn’t have nearly enough homes for sale. We didn’t have enough homes for lease,” said Los Angeles real estate agent Brita Kleingartner. “Now there’s an overwhelming demand, and we’re just starting to see what that looks like. All our agents have had their phones ring off the hook. Most of showings are for families who have lost everything. “It’s very sobering,” Kleingartner added. “The next week will be really heart breaking.” Some real estate agents are saying they’re already starting to see prices of rental units climb hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars a month. Prices of some units that had been on the market are up 15% to 20% in the last week, said Jeremiah Vancans, another Los Angeles real estate agent. “Demand is going to be through the roof,” he said. “The inventory was already pretty low. I imagine it’s going to create more upward pressure on prices.” But he said the longer-term impact on prices is tough to determine, as people are trying to get a sense of how much they might get from insurance for their losses. “It’s too early to really tell how this is going to affect the LA market,” he said. “People are still numb. The fires are still burning.” Realtors reported working 12-to-14-hour days because of the surge in demand. “There are basically no rentals,” said Jade Mills, a Beverly Hills realtor with Coldwell Banker. “I’ve been on the phone for the last two days asking my sellers if they’d be willing to rent, or calling rentals that are no longer available.” Her son lost his home in Pacific Pallisades, too. Restoring the city’s lost housing stock is likely to take at least three to five years, according to the real estate agents who spoke to CNN, because of the time it takes to clear the burned homes, reach settlements with insurance companies, work through the permitting process and then find the labor needed to rebuild. Vancans said in addition to the increased prices on some rental units, he’s concerned that those who lost their homes could get cash offers for the property where their houses once stood – the offers coming from what he calls “predatory buyers” who are seeking to take advantage of financial misfortune. A study of past wildfires by Redfin showed that the average prices for property can actually fall in the short term as fire-damaged homes or lots that need to be cleared of debris sell at a discount. But that decline doesn’t last. “Like much of the U.S., California is facing an acute housing shortage,” said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist for Redfin. “The wildfires themselves are also making housing more expensive.

"Apple backs its diversity policies, calling anti-DEI proposal ‘restricting’",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/apple-dei-companies/index.html,"Apple’s board of directors has recommended shareholders vote against a conservative think tank’s proposal to consider scrapping the tech giant’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. “At Apple, we believe that how we conduct ourselves is as critical to Apple’s success as making the best products in the world. We seek to conduct business ethically, honestly, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and our Business Conduct and Compliance policies are foundational to how we do business,” the company said Friday in its proxy statement. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) notified Apple in September that it intends to submit the anti-DEI proposal at Apple’s annual shareholder meeting on February 25. If passed by shareholders, it would require Apple to consider eliminating some or all of its DEI policies. But Apple said the proposal “inappropriately attempts to restrict” and “micromanage” company operations and policies. The company also said it has a “well-established compliance program,” and its board actively manages business and legal conduct to ensure it complies with laws in multiple jurisdictions. Stefan Padfield, executive director of the NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, said DEI poses risks, including litigation, customer backlash and divisiveness among employees, that outweigh the benefits. The NCPPR said that Apple “likely has over 50,000 who are potentially victims of this type of discrimination.” The NCPPR said if any employees sue the company, Apple could lose “tens of billions of dollars.” “We are simply asking for a consideration. The proposal, if approved, would not automatically result in the abolishment of DEI,” Padfield told CNN. He called Apple’s statement “non-responsive” and said that “corporations that have been pushing DEI have lost the goodwill to simply say ‘trust us.’” Apple’s diversity programs aren’t new. Its supplier diversity program was established in 1993 and works with various nonprofits, including the National Minority Supplier Development Council and National Veterans Business Development Council. Apple also hired its first vice president of inclusion and diversity in 2017 and has 67 employee groups known as “diversity network associations,” the first of which was established in 1986. But other companies are abandoning their commitments or renaming programs to “appear more palatable” to the incoming Trump administration and other critics, said Nani Vishwanath, a consultant and facilitator of DEI and employee experiences at the Courage Collective. Meta, John Deere and Walmart are among the companies that have made such changes to their DEI commitments following pressure from right-wing activists, legal groups, customers and President-elect Donald Trump. Changing DEI programs doesn’t necessarily shield a company from further backlash. McDonald’s, which announced on January 6 that it would roll back DEI practices, was sued Sunday by the American Alliance for Equal Rights, an anti-affirmative action group. The lawsuit claims the fast food company did not fully adhere to its commitment to treat “everyone” fairly because it kept a college scholarship program for Hispanic and Latino high school students. Other companies aren’t buckling to demand. The NCPPR has made similar proposals to shareholders of major companies, including retail giant Costco, whose board of directors recommended shareholders vote against DEI policies. “Those who are staying fiercely committed understand how it’s imperative,” Vishwanath said. Vishwanath said DEI is “vastly misunderstood” and companies don’t always understand why they implemented the programs. DEI efforts were originally intended to advance the representation of people from various identities and backgrounds, and this affected employee trainings, resource networks and recruiting practices. But there isn’t a single definition for DEI, which has complicated its implementation. She said these misunderstandings cause inconsistency with DEI initiatives. She suggested companies should ask themselves if DEI policies were “a reactive add-on or was it intrinsically important to the company’s success?” “(DEI) will continue to be met with curiosity or resentment,” said Vishwanath. “For organizations to remain relevant and meaningful to both their internal and external audiences, they need to think about what practices they need to evolve.”"
SoCal Edison blamed in a lawsuit for starting one of the Los Angeles fires,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/edison-power-company-lawsuit-eaton-fire/index.html,"Southern California Edison, the electrical utility for Los Angeles, has been sued for its alleged role in starting one of the raging Los Angeles fires that have collectively killed at least 24 people and displaced tens of thousands. Jeremy Gursey, whose house in the Altadena neighborhood was destroyed in the Eaton Fire, claimed in a lawsuit filed in LA County Superior Court Monday SCE was responsible for starting the fire – an allegation SCE has repeatedly denied. Local officials also said Monday they still have not determined the cause of the fires, although they are investigating an electrical transmission tower in Eaton Canyon as the possible origin site of the Eaton Fire, according to the Los Angeles Times. Gursey cited as evidence photographs taken by Altadena residents Jennifer Errico and Marcus Errico, who at around 6:15 p.m. on January 7 captured a small blaze underneath transmission lines running through Eaton Canyon. The Erricos on Friday told CNN’s Anderson Cooper they had spotted the start of the Eaton fire. “I saw a glow in the hillside right above our house,” Marcus Errico told CNN on Friday. “And as I got closer, I could see right across from us on the hillside in Eaton Canyon, there are a series of transformer towers with power lines stretching up into the mountains. And at the base of one, there was just a small ring of flames around the whole base.” Notably, Errico said he was unsure whether SCE was responsible for the blaze. “I can’t say definitively that it was the power lines that caused it,” Errico told CNN. “But I can say definitively that the first fire in Pasadena and Altadena – Eaton Canyon is right on the edge of Altadena and Pasadena – that’s where the fire began. It was under that tower on Tuesday night. It was - it began as a small little blaze underneath and within 10 minutes, the whole hillside was engulfed in the fire.” SCE in a statement Sunday said a review of circuits and transmission lines in the Eaton Canyon area showed its electrical equipment was unlikely to have caused the fire. “That analysis shows no interruptions or operational/electrical anomalies in the 12 hours prior to the fire’s reported start time until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire,” the utility said. SCE did not respond to a request for comment Monday on the lawsuit. Shares of SCE’s parent company, Edison International, (EIX) fell 10% Monday and are down 30% over the past week as investors fear the company may bear some financial responsibility for the fires. Other utilities that have been found liable have paid high costs: Pacific Gas and Electric, California’s largest utility, filed bankruptcy in 2019 after it was linked to a series of wildfires in California. And a group of companies that included Hawaiian Electric settled for $4 billion with residents for the businesses’ role in the 2023 Lahaina fire. Richard Bridgford, partner at Bridgford, Gleason & Artinian, who represents Gursey in the lawsuit filed Monday, said the evidence pointing to SCE is growing. “They stated that the distribution lines to the east of Eaton Canyon would be energized,” Bridgford said in an interview with CNN. “We happen to know the ignition point is directly below their line. We believe based upon the video evidence and based upon extensive discussion with our experts they will be found to have started the fire.” Bridgford said the company failure to de-energize its overhead wires despite a red flag wind warning issued by the National Weather Service makes SCE a likely culprit in the fire. Although there is no hard evidence yet, Bridgford said he believes “there’s always going to be more evidence coming.” Although Gursey’s lawsuit is the first against the electrical utility, it is almost certainly not the last. Bridgford has represented tens of thousands of wildfire victims in the past and said this lawsuit is just the start. “We have quite a few more lined up,” he said."
Industry groups sue to stop Biden from banning medical debt on credit reports,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/medical-debt-removed-credit-report-lawsuit/index.html,"Opposition is quickly forming against the Biden administration’s rule to ban medical debt from appearing on consumers’ credit reports, threatening the viability of what could be a popular regulation. Two industry groups filed lawsuits last week seeking to block the rule, which was finalized by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a week ago. Also, a leading House Republican lawmaker has promised to take action on the ban. The rule ends the inclusion of medical debt on credit reports and prevents lenders from using certain medical information in loan decisions. It is expected to remove an estimated $49 billion in medical bills from the credit reports of about 15 million consumers, which would likely raise credit scores and make it easier for some people to obtain mortgages, according to the bureau. The measure is scheduled to effect 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register. But the Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents credit bureaus such as TransUnion, Experian and Equifax, and ACA International, which represents debt collectors, argue that the rule violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the bureau lacks the authority to issue such a ban. “Americans are frustrated by medical bills. But frustration does not justify lawlessness,” ACA International wrote in its complaint, filed in the US District Court for Texas’ Southern District. “Here, a federal agency with no healthcare experience is exploiting this frustration by making a politically motivated regulation that prevents credit reporting agencies from showing accurate medical debts on credit reports. No agency has the power to do that.” Consumer debt is important to underwriting, and eliminating consideration of medical debt will erode the value of consumer credit reports, the Consumer Data Industry Association wrote in its complaint, filed in the US District Court for Texas’ Eastern District. “This leads to worse credit decisions, which in turn will harm consumers in the form of higher delinquency and default rates and increased costs of credit,” the complaint said, which noted the actions the three national credit bureaus took in 2022 to minimize the impact of unpaid medical bills on consumers. In addition to the lawsuits, GOP Rep. French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, last week blasted the bureau’s director, Rohit Chopra, for issuing the final rule. Congress has a limited period of time when it can review and rescind final rules, which has typically happened when a new president takes office. “Instead of focusing on enhancing economic opportunity for all consumers, Chopra’s regulatory overreach will drive up costs to any American seeking medical care and have a devastating impact on consumers’ access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas,” Hill said in a statement. “I look forward to working with the incoming Trump Administration to rectify this misguided action.” The bureau declined to comment on the lawsuits and Hill’s statement. The rule is expected to be popular with consumers, who have long complained about the high cost of health care in the US. But Jaret Seiberg, financial services analyst for TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report that the association laid out a strong argument in its lawsuit and will likely prevail. The legal action also minimizes the “political risk for Team Trump and the GOP Congress as neither will be seen by voters as backing the inclusion of medical debt on credit reports,” said Seiberg, who supports the credit bureaus’ efforts to block the rule."
Rachel Maddow returns to MSNBC five nights a week for Trump’s first 100 days,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/media/rachel-maddow-msnbc-trump-alex-wagner/index.html,"Rachel Maddow is returning to the anchor chair five nights a week. The MSNBC prime time star is expanding her on-air presence for the first 100 days of President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, the network announced Monday, injecting what may be a much-needed ratings boost into the progressive outlet’s lineup. Maddow’s show, MSNBC’s highest rated program, has only aired once a week since 2022 when she stepped away to focus on other projects, including films, books and podcasts. Her temporary return to the anchor desk weeknights at 9 p.m. ET will see Alex Wagner, who currently anchors the timeslot Tuesday through Friday, deployed on special assignment to cover the impact of the president-elect’s policies. Starting next week, Wagner’s coverage will be featured across MSNBC’s shows and platforms, the network said. Maddow will also lead the network’s live special inauguration coverage on Jan. 20. “The moment we’re in requires us to cover the early days of the new administration from all over the country — from the nation’s capital, where policy is being implemented, to talking to those in key communities and constituencies impacted by those policies,” MSNBC President Rashida Jones said in a statement. “No one is better equipped to bring those stories from the field to MSNBC viewers than our intrepid Alex Wagner.” In an interview with USA Today, Maddow said the decision to shuffle the network’s prime time schedule was made by Jones, adding that Wagner “has been itching to get out there in the country and to cover what’s coming and the impact of what Trump is going to do in the second term on the ground, from a front-line perspective.” After the 100-day window, there will be a “hard stop,” Maddow said, with both returning to their previous schedules. Maddow’s weeknight return comes as cable news networks have seen a downturn in viewership, including in prime time. While Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN all enjoyed a bump in ratings during 2024, all three have seen audience drops since the November election. Though news fatigue is a regular occurrence every four years after the presidential contest, the trend has exacerbated ongoing declines across the cable industry. Following the election, MSNBC’s parent company, Comcast, announced it would spin off most of its cable channels, including the cable news network, into a distinct, publicly traded company referred to as “SpinCo.” The move, which sheds cable channels that have seen their value decline in the streaming age, signaled an inflection point for the media industry as consumers continue to cut the cord. At MSNBC, harnessing Maddow’s star power five nights a week may not prove to be a panacea for all its difficulties but executives are banking on it to help buoy the progressive network’s viewership. “There’s a sort of head-in-the-sand wish casting that’s happening with a lot of people checking out of the news, thinking ‘If I don’t hear about it, if I don’t look at it, then maybe it’s not happening,’” Maddow told USA Today. “But people know that’s not actually the way to stop it from happening.  If this shambolic transition is anything to go on, the second Trump term is going to affect a lot of Americans, and they’re going to want to pay attention.”"
Here’s what TikTok users are saying about the looming ban,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/tiktok-ban-users-creators/index.html,"TikTok creators and users are facing the reality that the popular short-video app will likely be banned in the United States. A law that would effectively shut down TikTok nationwide may take effect Sunday if its China-based parent company, ByteDance, does not sell off the app and if the Supreme Court does not block the law. TikTok, which has 170 million monthly users in the United States, has faced competition from other apps trying to replicate its short-form video features. But TikTok stood out as a leader in quick entertainment and as a medium for creators to build a business or advertise for brands. Many of its content creators have begun to say their goodbyes and discuss their future plans. One creator, who uses the name Neiltheceo, said, “TikTok is leaving the United States on the 19th of this month. I’m not going to Instagram… I don’t like Instagram, I’m not going there. I might just put the phone down.” The TikTok ban could lead to a loss of income for creators, whose partnerships, monetization and followers aren’t guaranteed if they move to other platforms. TikTok creator Britton Copeland posted a video that floated the idea of boycotting all social media in response to the ban. She explained that TikTok helped her get an agent for a book she plans to release. Copeland also noted that creators “can’t just not work.” “It sucks because I feel like I’m this close — this close to having my dream,” she said. A creator known as Mrs. Space Cadet, who has almost 1 million followers, said TikTok “started the career that I have now.” In the comment section, she said she is on Instagram and has started posting on YouTube. “I know it’s not the same, but it’s something,” she said. Duke Depp, who amassed almost 20 million followers by dressing as Willy Wonka, took a trip down memory lane by reposting viral moments. He encouraged users to subscribe to his YouTube and Snapchat accounts. “All week I’m using my account to remember PEAK Tiktok, before the platform is gone for good,” he commented. Anyone who wants continued access to the app could move to another country, a creator joked in a video posted to the platform. “It’s like summer camp is over and we will never see our camp friends again,” a user said in another post. There are limited options for sharing short videos beyond Instagram’s Reels and YouTube’s Shorts. Lemon8, a photo- and video-sharing app also owned by ByteDance, gained popularity during earlier threats to ban TikTok, but it could be banned under the US law, too. About 180,000 users have signed up for Neptune, an app expected to be released sometime in 2025. The app’s website says it will have a customizable algorithm, monetization and no follower counts. “If we want another TikTok, it’s gonna have to happen naturally,” one user posted. They said this ban is similar to when Vine shut down and users moved to YouTube and Musical.ly, which merged with TikTok in 2018. One user commented: “I have videos that go all the way back to 2016… why are they deleting my memories.” Video-sharing competitor Triller has tried to capitalize on those concerns by creating Save My TikToks, which will upload TikTok videos to the Triller app. Users who recently joined the app may have a short-lived experience. An “elder millennial” posted to TikTok that she was hesitant to join. After using the app for a few months, she has realized “how terrible the other (social media apps) are.” TikTok is expected to be removed from US app stores by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and Apple following a ban, so the app won’t have updates or be available for download. Singer-songwriter Noah Kahan posted to X: “If tiktok goes away I wonder if my body just evaporates similar to that avengers movie.” ByteDance has repeatedly said TikTok isn’t for sale. In March, Steve Mnuchin, who served as Treasury secretary during Donald Trump’s first term, said he had put together a group of investors to buy TikTok. “Shark Tank” co-host Kevin O’Leary told Yahoo! Finance last week that he is part of a group that’s prepared to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok. But there are big stumbling blocks, including the narrow window to reach a deal and the widely varied value of the app. A buyer would also likely not have access to the app’s powerful algorithm to hook users, which makes TikTok so valuable."
Walmart’s logo got its first facelift in nearly 20 years,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/walmart-new-logo/index.html,"Walmart is giving its logo the first facelift in nearly two decades, rolling out a new identity that is a subtle nod to its past. The 61-year-old company unveiled Monday a refresh of its brand identity featuring a redesigned logo the company says is inspired by founder Sam Walton’s old trucker hat. Walmart’s logo now uses a chunkier font compared to its previous iteration, with the new font being inspired from a typeface the chain used from the 1980s through the early 2000s. Walmart is retaining the yellow “spark” often used with the logo; however, a darker blue has been introduced to “keep the brand fresh,” the company said. The new logo will appear on its website and app this month and over time will roll out to its 10,500 stores, which are also in the midst of getting a makeover. “This update, rooted in the legacy of our founder, Sam Walton, demonstrates our evolving capabilities and longstanding commitment to serve our customers of today and tomorrow,” William White, senior vice president and chief marketing officer of Walmart US, said in a statement. Walmart last tweaked its logo in 2008, when it dropped the star used between Wal and Mart and combined the words into one. The new identity was tied with a period of slumping sales for the company amid rising competition from other big box retailers, like Target. However, this new look arrives at a time when business is booming for Walmart. Sales at its US stores open for at least a year grew about 5% in last quarter compared with the year prior, the company said in its most recent earnings report, and its profit grew 8%. Walmart has drawn higher-income customers by investing in its grocery business and using its massive scale to drive down prices amid a historic bout of inflation. It has also sharpened its assortment of clothing, electronics, home furnishings and other goods. In addition, it has bolstered its online operations against Amazon, with sales growing 22% in the US last quarter."
"Soon to be out of a job, Meta’s fact-checkers battle a blaze of wildfire conspiracy theories",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/tech/meta-fact-checkers-wildfire-conspiracy-theories/index.html,"Just hours after Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg announced last Tuesday that the social media giant would eliminate its US-based fact-checkers, the iconic hills above Los Angeles began to smolder. As fire crews scrambled in vain to contain the resulting firestorm, the fact-checking partners, still working for Meta, took on their own fight: trying to slow viral misinformation rapidly spreading around the wildfires. Rumor and speculation about the disaster began to swirl online like glowing embers, before eventually becoming a wild blaze of vast conspiracy theories. “Cutting fact checkers from social platforms is like disbanding your fire department,” said Alan Duke, a former CNN journalist who co-founded the fact-checking outlet Lead Stories, one of dozens of such organizations around the world funded by Meta. Meta has not announced when it will formally end its fact-checking program, but a person familiar with the program said it could be eliminated as soon as March. The decision will force some of Meta’s fact-checking partners to lay off staff or shut down once the company’s financial support dries up. Duke, a Los Angeles resident, could see the orange glow of the fires from his home as he and his colleagues at Lead Stories worked to tackle conspiracy theories about the blazes that have left at least two dozen people dead. “Fires and looting. A regular Democrat run city,” read the caption on an Instagram video showing men removing a television from a home amid the fires. After Lead Stories fact-checked the claim and found that the men were not looters, but in fact the resident’s family helping save their belongings, Meta placed a fact-check label on the video. When a post is labeled as false or misleading, Meta says it applies penalties that “significantly reduce that content’s distribution so that fewer people see” it and also notifies users who try to share the post. PolitiFact, the Florida-based Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-check organization that also is part of Meta’s program, debunked a viral post on Threads falsely claiming Los Angeles police were “looking for three ‘persons of interest’ all tied to a MAGA website who were spotted at the source of all three major LA fire.” PolitiFact also debunked an image circulating on Instagram that purported to show the iconic Hollywood sign on fire. PolitiFact said the false image was likely created using artificial intelligence. Much of the misinformation swirling online was of a distinctively partisan nature and spread beyond Meta’s platforms by some of the most widely followed and influential figures on the internet. False claims promoted by President-elect Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform sought to blame the Democratic Party for the wildfires. On X, Elon Musk downplayed the role of climate change while repeatedly blaming diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies for the fires. “DEI means people will DIE,” Musk posted. The disgraced conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed on X that the fires were “part of a larger globalist plot to wage economic warfare and deindustrialize the United States before trigger total collapse.” “True,” Musk wrote in a response to Jones. Like the devastating Maui wildfires in 2023 and Hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024, conspiracy theorists claimed the Los Angeles fires had been deliberately set by the government. Some baselessly suggested the government was controlling the weather and directing strong winds to spread the fires. “The false claims we are seeing on the wildfires are similar to what happened with the recent hurricane that slammed the southeast a few months ago. It creates distrust of emergency agencies that are actively responding to the disaster, making it more difficult for them during the crisis,” Duke told CNN. “The same thing happened after the Maui fires in 2023,” he added. “Space lasers were blamed. It was allegedly a conspiracy to steal the land. Unless the false claims are countered with facts collected and assessed by professionals, the myths and distrust will continue to spread.” But removing professional fact-checkers from the equation is precisely what Zuckerberg intends to do. In his announcement last Tuesday, the billionaire said he planned to replace the fact-checking program that was created in the wake of Trump’s 2016 election with something similar to X’s Community Notes feature. Community Notes is a crowd-sourced form of fact-checking where the platform’s users can append notes to debunk or provide further context to posts. Community Notes only appear on posts when X users with “diverse perspectives” agree a post warrants one, the Musk-owned company outlines in a somewhat obscure explanation on its website. “Community Notes doesn’t work by majority rules. To identify notes that are helpful to a wide range of people, notes require agreement between contributors who have sometimes disagreed in their past ratings. This helps prevent one-sided ratings,” the company says. Unlike fact-checking journalists, however, community users are not bound by ethical guidelines to provide fair and accurate assessments. Fact checks in the form of Community Notes have been added to posts on X, including on a video with more than 500,000 views that falsely purported to show the fire approaching the Hollywood sign (An assessment by Lead Stories found the video was likely created using artificial intelligence). Another Community Note offered a robust fact-check of a post from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene about the fire that played into conspiracy theories about the government’s ability to control the weather. But other posts baselessly suggesting the fires had been planned by the government, started using lasers, and spread through weather manipulation have gone unchecked on X. Alex Jones’ baseless claim that the fires are part of a “globalist plot” has not been marked with a Community Note and as of Sunday had been viewed more than 17 million times. Angie Drobnic Holan, the director of the International Fact-Checking Network, whose members are part of the Meta fact-checking program, told CNN that while Community Notes has had some success, it is no substitute for professional fact-checks. “Professional fact-checkers can tackle a wider variety of complex conspiracy theories and political claims, while community-based systems excel mainly at flagging obvious visual misattribution,” Holan said."
Japanese Prime Minister raises concerns with Biden over his move to block Nippon Steel deal for US Steel,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/japan-prime-minister-biden-nippon-steel-deal-us-steel/index.html,"Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba asked US President Joe Biden to allay concerns in the Japanese and US business communities over his order to block Nippon Steel’s planned acquisition of U.S. Steel. Ishiba made the request in a three-way online meeting with Biden and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday, which covered issues of economic security and cooperation in maritime security in the South China Sea, according to a spokesman from Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Prime Minister Ishiba pointed out that cooperation among allies and like-minded countries is indispensable for establishing resilient supply chains, and that it is important to make efforts to ensure that companies can invest with peace of mind in order to promote economic security,” he added. The spokesman confirmed that Ishiba mentioned the Nippon Steel-U.S. Steel deal in particular. The Biden administration has delayed until June an order for Nippon Steel to abandon its $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel, the companies said on Saturday, after the president earlier blocked the acquisition on national security grounds on Jan. 3. The parties previously had 30 days to unwind their transaction. The delay will give the courts time to review lawsuits brought by Nippon and US Steel challenging Biden’s order blocking the deal. Nippon Steel and US Steel have announced their intention to move forward with their efforts to close the deal. They filed federal lawsuits against both the federal action to block the deal, as well as against the United Steelworkers union and rival domestic steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs, which both worked to stop the deal from going through."
There’s a reason why it feels like the internet has gone bad,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/enshittification-internet-meta-nightcap/index.html,"Facebook is full of AI slop. X is full of “free thinkers” peddling conspiracies. Google’s search results are telling us to eat rocks. More and more, it feels like the internet has gone bad. There’s an increasingly popular theory about why: “enshittification.” The term, coined in 2022 by the author, journalist and activist Cory Doctorow, refers broadly to the deterioration of services (especially online) as a result of giant companies extracting maximum profits from their customers. In a 2023 essay for Wired, Doctorow laid out the basic arc of enshittification, or the process by which platforms die. “First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.” In other words: Products are good when they first hit the market, because companies need to lock in as many consumers as they can to achieve the huge scale they desire. Once everyone’s using the product, the company refocuses on creating value for business partners, padding its profit margins and letting the product corrode. Eventually, the company maxes out what it can extract from its business partners, too, and the whole thing fades into obsolescence. Once you wrap your head around the idea, you start to see enshittification all around — not only online, but across the economy, in services that have been picked over by private equity (vet clinics, nursing homes, prisons, countless other industries) or in the products peddled by highly concentrated industries. The Australian dictionary Macquarie even crowned it the 2024 word of the year, noting its power to capture “what many of us feel is happening to the world and to so many aspects of our lives at the moment.” On Tuesday, shortly after Meta’s CEO announced a widely criticized plan to dispense with fact-checkers, I spoke with Doctorow about the future of social media and how “enshittification” can help us make sense of our collective online angst. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Nightcap: Could you give me your your cocktail-party-level introduction to “enshittification”? Cory Doctorow: I think of enshittification as a theory about what happens when you have power without consequence. We have increased the power available to large firms for a long time by reducing our antitrust enforcement, allowing mergers, predatory pricing, all the conduct that allows firms to get very big. That’s been across the board, not just with tech. Nightcap: What does that look like, in real life? Doctorow: There’s a law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that makes it illegal to break digital rights management. So for example, if Audible (which is owned by Amazon) sells you one of my audiobooks, they require that it have digital rights management that locks it to Audible’s platform forever — you can’t unlock it, quit Audible and take your books with you. And if I give you a tool to jailbreak the audiobook so you can go somewhere else, I commit a felony punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine. So even though I am the rights holder to that work, Amazon, the intermediary who sold you the work, has more intellectual-property rights to that work than I do. This is a law that is oriented around allowing these large firms to wield regulation against competitors, against their own workforce and against their users so that they can maintain power. It’s a collapse of discipline — they don’t have to worry about their workers, they don’t have to worry about regulators. And they bought all their competitors. Nightcap: Meta would seem like a kind of textbook case of enshittification. Facebook used to feel like a premium service, but the last few years it’s felt like it’s lost the plot. Doctorow: Meta is a great example because they go through this pretty neat set of stages… They had this very straightforward value prop, which was like, just tell us who matters to you, and we’ll show you everything they post. And their pitch to the general public was, Facebook is like MySpace, but we won’t spy on you. Nightcap: Right, that feels very much like aughts-era Facebook, when we could all just see our friends and enjoy the virtual connection. What changed? Doctorow: Facebook at a certain point goes to publishers and says, create a Facebook page, post short excerpts to it, don’t worry about how many people follow you — we’re going to recommend it to users. So we’re going to show users things that they never asked to see in order to take some value away from them and give it to publishers. You see the same thing with advertisers. Facebook not only offers to use surveillance data to benefit advertisers in the form of targeting, but they also invest heavily in anti-ad-fraud and in services to advertisers. So if your ads are not performing, they’ll help you figure it out, but also, if someone’s ripping you off, they’ll help you get your money back. And so you see the users getting locked in by each other. They’re providing so much value to each other that they can’t bring themselves to leave, even as the service is getting monotonically worse. And that’s as far as I think a lot of people take it — “Facebook’s got a mind control ray, they’re hacking your dopamine loops, and you can’t escape Facebook and they’re gonna sell you to advertisers.” The evidence for “hacking your dopamine loops” is pretty thin. There’s much better evidence that people just care about their friends more than they hate Mark Zuckerberg, and so they stay there. Nightcap: Your theory adds a third step here, where Facebook also turns its back on advertisers, too? Doctorow: Right, once the advertisers were fully committed to a Facebook strategy, advertising got way more expensive and the amount of ad fraud you got was crazy. So the advertisers are getting screwed, the publishers are getting screwed, the end users are getting screwed. Nightcap: I’m not asking you to look into a crystal ball here, but if you had to speculate, what’s next for Facebook or other decaying platforms? Doctorow: Zuckerberg is insulated from the consequences of making bad choices until he’s not, right? Until things reach a breaking point, and then he tends to panic. Tech calls these panics “pivots,” but they’re just the outcome of being the CEO of a company that posts anemic growth or even a contraction in its user base and sees (Wall Street) just go nuts on you. First, it was the Metaverse… which is like a not-very-successful video game that they spent billions on. Zuck could do that because he controls the majority of the voting shares and because he had huge cash reserves. And now we’re seeing these weird announcements that they’re going to have AI -generated users who are going to interact with you. This is, again, a visibly terrible idea. It could be a way to continue to post growth if users will tolerate it. But the equilibrium that Zuck has shot for, with Facebook and with Instagram, has been a service that is nearly so bad that people want to leave. The anthropologist danah boyd describes how in the last days of MySpace, she could see how when one person who a lot of people talk to would leave, then a whole bunch of people would follow. It wasn’t the only reason they were there, but it was the last thing keeping them there, and then, boom, the bottom falls out and the net just starts to unravel. This is where Facebook is. They are trying to maintain this equilibrium where they extract enough that they keep their shareholders happy, but not so much that people leave. They’re now at the end of a long run of extremely bad choices. I’m not shorting Meta stock, but I think that they are on the path to becoming a kind of zombie — something like MySpace is today. You know, MySpace still exists. You can go to MySpace. It’s just AI-generated slop and and spam. (Note: Meta didn’t respond to Nightcap’s request for comment.) Nightcap: How are you feeling about the future of tech? Doctorow: In terms of the future of enshittification, these platforms that have hollowed themselves out, where there’s just no value left in them except this kind of awful lock-in. It’s the old “we go broke a little, and then all at once.” I do think there is reason to be hopeful. As a science fiction writer, I know that prediction is a mug’s game. But as an activist, I’m like, well, you take the weakest flank where you can make the biggest strategic advance, and you march on that flank. And there are a lot of weak flanks in global big tech. I’d say the last one is the potential for an alliance between people who are angry about other kinds of monopolies, because it’s not just tech — people are really angry about grocery monopolies and oil monopolies, sea freight monopolies, eyeglass monopolies. One company, EssilorLuxottica, owns every eyewear brand you’ve ever heard of and every eyewear store you’ve ever shopped at, and they make more than 50% of the lenses, and they own EyeMed, the largest insurer in the world, and they’ve raised the price of glasses 1,000% in the last decade. (EssilorLuxottica didn’t respond to Nightcap’s request for comment.) So people are pissed off about monopolies. And if they can make a coalition, it’ll be like when we discovered the word “ecology” in the ’70s — we realized that just because you care about owls and I care about the ozone layer, it doesn’t mean we’re not caring about the same thing. Every time you see the world change all of a sudden, it’s because a new coalition has popped up."
"Jen Rubin exits Washington Post, joins Norm Eisen to launch new outlet countering ‘authoritarian threat’",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/media/jennifer-rubin-norm-eisen-contrarian-washington-post/index.html,"Veteran opinion columnist Jennifer Rubin is becoming the latest in a long list of Washington Post figures to leave the troubled institution. Rubin is partnering with former White House ethics czar Norm Eisen and launching something new: a startup publication called The Contrarian. The startup’s tagline, “Not owned by anybody,” is a pointed reference to billionaire Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos and other moguls who, in Rubin’s view, have “bent the knee” to President-elect Donald Trump. “Our goal is to combat, with every fiber of our being, the authoritarian threat that we face,” Rubin told CNN in an interview ahead of the publication’s introduction. Rather than anti-Trump, the founders describe their venture as pro-democracy. They said they have already enlisted about two dozen contributors, including people who played prominent roles in debunking 2020 election denialism and investigating the January 6, 2021, attack at the US Capitol. “The voices we’ll be featuring are diverse across parties and generations,” Eisen said in a statement, “connected by the shared belief that we need an unshackled media in order to meet this moment, as we face an existential threat to American democracy.” The Contrarian joins a growing group of publications – like The Bulwark and Zeteo, to name two – that are built on the Substack newsletter platform. Starting Monday, it will publish some content for free but will charge $7 a month for complete access to columns, podcasts, and videos. Eisen, a regular presence on cable news who is departing his CNN legal analyst role, will be the publisher. Rubin will be the editor-in-chief. A 14-year veteran of the Post’s opinion section, Rubin said she resigned because “the Post, along with most mainstream news outlets, has failed spectacularly at a moment that we most need a robust, aggressive free press.” “I fear that things are going from bad to worse at The Post,” she added. Rubin cited numerous controversies, including Bezos blocking the editorial board’s planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris in October and Amazon, which Bezos founded, making a $1 million donation to Trump’s inaugural fund. She said a major factor in her exit was the Post’s recent refusal to publish a satirical cartoon by Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes showing Bezos and others on bended knee. Telnaes resigned as a result. The Post’s opinion editor David Shipley defended his decision to nix the cartoon in an internal memo last Friday, calling it a “sound editorial decision” because other Post columns had referenced Bezos and Trump and “yet another piece in the span of a few days struck me as overkill.” Both the opinion and newsroom departments at the Post have, indeed, covered Bezos rigorously. But Rubin’s concerns about the Post, including about its independence, have been shared by others, and boldface names from both departments have departed in the past couple of months, sapping morale inside the organization. Rubin said the name of her outfit, The Contrarian, signaled “we’re not going with the herd,” meaning with the billionaire types that have sought to “curry favor” with the president-elect. She said subscribers could expect “reported opinion and commentary” about political news, but also cultural coverage that might appeal to people who don’t follow politics closely. Humorist Andy Borowitz, who parted ways with The New Yorker in 2023 and now has his own home on Substack, will be a contributor. Eisen, a former US ambassador to the Czech Republic, said, “I know from my experience in Europe that the dissident movements there have been led by those in humor, satire, and culture like my friend President Václav Havel who was a playwright.” “We will bring in a large array of voices – you need that to fight autocracy,” he added. “Laughing may actually end up being more important than political and legal analysis!” Rubin and Eisen will face the same challenges as other digital startups: distribution hurdles, marketing constraints and a general reticence from readers to give up a credit card and pay for a subscription. But Rubin does have one data point as motivation. In the wake of the Post’s non-endorsement scandal, at least 250,000 customers dropped their subscriptions. For a Post veteran walking out the door in protest, those fellow protesters might be the starting point for a new subscription business."
Kohl’s is closing 27 locations. See if your store is on the list,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/kohls-store-closures-list/index.html,"Kohl’s is closing 27 stores across more than a dozen states as the struggling retailer looks to improve profitability. The closures, to be completed by April, are a small fraction of the chain’s 1,150 stores and were listed as “underperforming,” according to a press release. Kohl’s said it “continues to believe in the health and strength of its profitable store base.” It’s one of the last decisions made by outgoing CEO Tom Kingsbury, who is stepping down Wednesday and being replaced next week by Ashley Buchanan, the chief executive of arts and crafts chain Michaels. Kingsbury will stay on as an advisor to Buchanan and on the company’s board until his retirement in May. “We always take these decisions very seriously,” Kingsbury said in the release. “As we continue to build on our long-term growth strategy, it is important that we also take difficult but necessary actions to support the health and future of our business for our customers and our teams.” Like many department stores in recent years, Kohl’s has spent the last few years in turmoil and has struggled to recover from shifting consumer behavior. And it doesn’t anticipate that it had a robust holiday shopping season, with the retailer recently forecasting a larger drop in sales than previously expected. Kohl’s (KSS) stock have fallen nearly 40% over the past six months. In 2022, the company was engaged in a messy battle with activist investors who tried to push Kohl’s to spin off its online business, sell its real estate or take the company private.  The retailer also dropped exploring a sale in 2022. Kohl’s closures come on the heels of Macy’s announcing similar news last week. Macy’s targeted 66 locations to shut down in the coming weeks as it also struggles attracting shoppers amid inflationary pressure. These are the locations Kohl’s plans on closing: 21000 Town Center Ave. (Spanish Fort) 13909 Chenal Pkwy (Little Rock) 5505 Balboa Ave. (San Diego) 134 N.

"Biden unveils last round of AI chip curbs aimed at China, Russia",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/tech/china-us-biden-chips-ai-curbs-hnk-intl/index.html,"The Biden administration has issued new restrictions on the export of US-developed computer chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) systems, in a final effort to prevent rivals like China from accessing the advanced technology, just a week before leaving office. The fresh curbs, the culmination of years of attempts to block China from gaining ground in its military and industrial leadership efforts, are expected to further inflame tensions between Washington and Beijing ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump next week. They’ve also triggered intense criticism from US tech giants like Nvidia and Oracle. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said the new rules were “designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries, but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.” The global export framework, announced Monday, creates three tiers of countries for exports of advanced AI chips and technology. There are no new restrictions for partners and allies like Australia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. A second tier of countries including China and Russia, which are already blocked from buying advanced chips, will be newly subject to restrictions on the sale of the most powerful “closed” AI models, which refer to models whose underlying architectures are not released to the public. The biggest changes will be faced by the third group, which comprises most of the world, which will soon have new caps on the amount of computing power that can be bought, although they will be able to apply for additional quotas subject to certain security requirements. Analysts have said this change is intended to prevent China from accessing AI chips through third countries, particularly in the Middle East. The restrictions are being announced against a global backdrop of soaring demand for AI chips made by the likes of Nvidia, AMD and Intel. With days to go before Biden leaves office, the rules now enter a 120-day comment period but will take effect before that period is over. “We hope that the next administration takes full advantage of those 120 days to listen to experts, industry, industry players, partner countries,” Raimondo said. “I fully expect the next administration may make changes as a result of that input.” Senior Biden administration officials, speaking on background, were asked Sunday about the extent to which they consulted with the incoming Trump administration. Officials would only acknowledge there were “ongoing discussions about a range of issues.” “We believe we’re in a critical window right now, particularly vis-a-vis China,” one official said. “Every minute counts from our perspective.” The latest measures were announced just a month after the outgoing administration announced curbs on the sale of two dozen types of semiconductor-making equipment and restrictions on numerous Chinese companies from accessing American technology. Since October 2022, the administration has announced several rounds of semiconductor export restrictions targeting Beijing. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made self-sufficiency a major pillar of his economic strategy to make China a tech superpower. Tech giants Nvidia, the world’s largest provider of processors that power AI, and Oracle as well as an influential semiconductor industry group blasted the newest restrictions, accusing the Biden administration of bureaucratic overreach and saying they would harm US competitiveness. In a blog post published on Monday, Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, wrote the adoption of AI around the world fuels growth and opportunity for industries at home and abroad. “That global progress is now in jeopardy. The Biden Administration now seeks to restrict access to mainstream computing applications with its unprecedented and misguided ‘AI Diffusion’ rule which threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide,” he wrote. “While cloaked in the guise of an ‘anti-China’ measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance US security,” he added. Oracle Executive Vice President Ken Glueck wrote last week the rule “does more to achieve extreme regulatory overreach than protect US interests and those of our partners and allies.” “It practically enshrines the law of intended consequences and will cost the US critical technology leadership,” he said. Last week, the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association said it was “deeply concerned by the unprecedented scope and complexity of this potential regulation, which was developed without industry input and could significantly undercut US leadership and competitiveness in semiconductor technology and advanced AI systems.”"
Bad news for young Americans struggling to find work,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/young-workers-job-market/index.html,"Cam Tangalakis-Lippert has submitted hundreds of job applications since being laid off from her software engineering gig at Twitch a year ago. The 25-year-old Sacramento resident told CNN she’s a few months away from running out of money. Tangalakis-Lippert is one of millions of Americans in their 20s who are struggling to find a job these days. In 2024, businesses were unusually slow to hire as workers quit their jobs less frequently — a phenomenon known as “The Great Stay.” Those conditions are expected to largely remain the same this year, according to economists, keeping young Americans from getting their foot in the door or from getting back on their feet after layoffs. Studies show that early setbacks in a worker’s career can affect their lifetime earnings, mental health and career development. “It’s been excruciating,” Tangalakis-Lippert said. “I’m no longer focusing all of my energy on trying to get a software engineering job. I’ve applied for a job at Best Buy, at every grocery store.” “It feels really bad going from making $100,000 a year to probably having to work minimum wage,” she added. The US job market overall remains on solid footing, with unemployment at a low 4.1% as employers continue to add jobs at a brisk pace. But it has slowed steadily over the past two years, normalizing from the heydays of 2022 when there were a record 12.2 million openings. As a result, there was unusually slow churn in the job market last year: The rate at which Americans are hired declined to 2013 levels — with white-collar industries and manufacturing pulling back the most — as the quit rate hovered below pre-pandemic levels. That slower churn has had an outsized impact on younger workers. Employment of workers aged 25 to 34 saw the second-largest annual decline in December across all age groups, according to Labor Department data released Friday. Employment among those 20-24 was down slightly that month. Meanwhile, for the 35-44 and 45-54 cohorts, employment was up during the same period. Younger workers in certain industries could be in for an especially hard year. “In those sitting-down type of jobs, or white-collar jobs, it will continue to be tough for those recent graduates or young unemployed folks,” said Andrew Flowers, an economist at recruitment marketing firm Appcast. Flowers pointed to persistent woes in the tech industry. “We’re already at full employment, and one of the implications of that is that the rate of hiring slows.” Alexander Bloukos graduated in August with a master’s degree in international political economy from the London School of Economics but hasn’t found a job. He has submitted hundreds of applications over the past few months, yielding only a few dozen interviews, he told CNN. The 23-year-old, who lives with his parents in Boston, said friends around his age have been dealing with the same challenges. “I think we’re just getting crowded out by people with more experience,” Bloukos said. “It’s kind of depressing, but you just have to figure out a way to keep moving forward.” Hiring of younger folks could eventually pick up if the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates. The central bank has already rolled out three rate cuts since September. “Lower borrowing costs are actually translating into improved affordability and more business activity,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. “The labor market lags those kinds of improvements in economic conditions and business activity, but not by that much. If these improvements are sustained, you’re going to see hiring pick up in the next few months, and that will lead to more job switching.” The outlook varies by industry. Pollak said hiring in finance may increase this year because of expected deregulation and a more favorable environment for mergers and acquisitions. However, Wall Street isn’t pricing in additional rate cuts until later in the year, based on inflation’s limited progress in recent months. The economy’s resilience in the face of elevated borrowing costs also suggests that Fed officials don’t need to be in any rush to cut interest rates further. And even if hiring increases, it could take a while to help young workers. “Young workers, women, Black workers, they’re often last in and first out, so it does typically take a bit of time before their conditions improve,” Pollak said. “Let’s say openings and net job gains start picking up six months from now. It will take another three to six months after that before marginal groups start to see any meaningful gains.”"
China’s exports surge amid trade tensions,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/china-exports-trade-tension-hnk-intl/index.html,"China’s exports gained momentum in December, with imports also showing recovery, though strength at the year-end was in part fueled by factories rushing inventory overseas as they braced for heightened trade risks under a Trump presidency. Exports have been a vital growth engine for the $18 trillion economy, which is still burdened by a prolonged property crisis and shaky consumer confidence. While policymakers can find solace in recent policy measures keeping the economy on track for an “around 5%” growth target, challenges such as potential US tariff hikes cloud the outlook for 2025. US President-elect Donald Trump, set to return to the White House next week, has proposed hefty tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking fears of a renewed trade war between the two superpowers. Adding to the challenges, unresolved disputes with the European Union over tariffs of up to 45.3% on Chinese electric vehicles threaten to hinder China’s ambitions to expand its auto exports and help address deflationary overcapacity concerns. “Trade front-loading became more visible in December as a result of both Chinese New Year effects and Donald Trump’s inauguration,” said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. China’s biggest festival runs from January 28 to February 4. “Import growth could be underpinned by stockpiling of commodities like copper and iron ore, as part of (China’s) ‘buy low’ strategy,” he added. Outbound shipments in December rose 10.7% year-on-year, customs data showed on Monday, beating 7.3% growth forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and improving from November’s 6.7% increase. Imports surprised to the upside with 1.0% growth, the strongest performance since July 2024. Economists had expected a 1.5% decline. China’s trade surplus grew to $104.8 billion last month, up from $97.4 billion in November. Its trade surplus with the US widened to $33.5 billion over the same period from $29.81 billion a month prior. A Chinese customs spokesperson told reporters there was still “huge” room for China’s imports to grow this year. Buoyed by a weakening yuan, Chinese manufacturers managed to find buyers overseas in 2024 to compensate for depressed domestic demand by continually reducing prices, analysts said. As a result, China’s exports grew by an annual 5.9% last year, while imports increased just 1.1% over the same period. “The double-digit rise in December exports (led by the US and ASEAN), along with the increase in the PMI new export orders, supports our earlier judgment that the threat of tariffs could affect export patterns in the next couple of quarters, with a potential boost in shipments before the introduction of new tariffs, followed by a drop-off,” Barclays analysts said in a note. “Overall, we think the modest increase in imports and easing CPI inflation suggest the recent domestic demand recovery is still too shallow and too weak.” Market reaction was muted to the trade data. The yuan hovered near 16-month lows against the dollar, while key share indexes were down. Signs of stabilization have emerged following China’s recent stimulus push. Factory activity remained in modest expansion for the third consecutive month, while services and construction recovered in December, an official survey showed. South Korea, a key indicator of China’s imports, reported a 8.6% increase in shipments to China in December, suggesting resilience in demand for technology products. China’s iron ore imports in 2024 rose for a second straight year to hit a new peak, as lower prices spurred buying and demand remained resilient despite the country’s protracted property crisis continuing to weigh on steel demand. The world’s largest agricultural importer also bought a record amount of soybeans last year, after buyers concerned about US-China trade tensions rushed to secure US soybeans ahead of incoming US president Donald Trump’s inauguration. But crude oil imports fell last year, the data showed, marking its first annual decline in the last two decades outside the Covid-19 pandemic-induced falls, as tepid economic growth and peaking fuel consumption dampened purchases. China’s top leaders have pledged to loosen monetary policy and adopt a more proactive fiscal policy in 2025, aiming to offset external pressures and revitalize domestic demand. The government is targeting economic growth of around 5% for the year, a goal that had proved challenging to achieve at times in 2024."
Meta oversight co-chair says the company looks like it’s ‘buckling to political pressure’ by ending fact-checking program,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/business/meta-oversight-fact-checking-political/index.html,"Meta’s decision to end its fact-checking program looks like the company is “caving” to political pressures, said Meta’s oversight board co-chair Michael McConnell. McConnell, who is a law professor at Stanford University, told NPR on Friday that he would have liked to have seen changes made during “less contentious and partisan times so that they would be considered on the merits rather than looking like this is, you know, Donald Trump is president and now they’re caving.” Changes to Meta’s fact-checking program come within two weeks of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration and after CEO Mark Zuckerberg dined at Mar-a-Lago in November. Meta and other tech giants, which have faced fierce criticism from Trump in recent years, have made large donations to Trump’s inaugural fund. Meta did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. “I do think that there’s bad optics here,” said McConnell, who said he was speaking personally and not on behalf of the board. “It certainly looks like this is buckling to political pressure.” Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday that Meta’s partnership with third-party fact-checkers would be replaced with user-generated “community notes” at Facebook, Instagram and Threads, a policy similar to Elon Musk’s X. The company also quietly updated its hateful conduct policy, striking old rules about content that cannot be posted, including referring to “women as household objects or property” or “transgender or non-binary people as ‘it.’” “Fact-checkers have been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they’ve created,” Zuckerberg said in a video announcing the new policy. “What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it’s gone too far.” Zuckerberg acknowledged that the changes would “reduce the number of innocent people’s posts and accounts that we accidentally take down,” but there would be more harmful content on the platform. McConnell said official revisions to Meta’s hate speech policy “came as a surprise” to board members. Meta first implemented its fact-checking program in 2016 after claims it didn’t stop foreign actors, especially Russia, from using its platforms to spread disinformation. Meta has since faced scrutiny for misinformation about elections, anti-vaccination stories, violence and hate speech. Meta’s newly appointed Chief of Global Affairs Joel Kaplan told Fox News on Tuesday that Meta’s use of third-party fact-checkers was “well-intentioned” but showed too much political bias. Trump later said he watched Kaplan’s appearance and said Meta has “come a long way.” Trump is among the Republicans who have criticized Meta for what they view as censorship of right-wing voices. McConnell said there is “pretty overwhelming evidence” that fact-checkers correct more content from right-wing users, but knowing whether those users spread more misinformation is “a very difficult thing to measure.” He also said there has been “active and vigorous debate” within the Meta oversight board. “The oversight board is a global enterprise, and there’s a huge difference in the way in which Americans think about freedom of speech and other places around the world,” McConnell said. “And that really plays out. It’s also true that the fact-checking program has been much more contentious and controversial in the United States, not so much elsewhere.” McConnell said he doesn’t know what this change means for future elections or foreign government propaganda on the social media platforms. “There is really no magic bullet to this problem,” he said. “But much of this has to do with not whether the information is true or false but where it’s coming from.”"
NYC is the first US city with congestion pricing. Surviving 2025 is the key test,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/business/nyc-congestion-pricing-2025/index.html,"New York City’s long-awaited, long-debated congestion pricing began on January 5, marking a new era for driving into Manhattan. Congestion pricing could generate revenue many cities are desperate for, while simultaneously easing traffic and improving air quality. But legal challenges and President-elect Donald Trump’s opposition could determine whether it’s a blip or a new US trend. The incoming president, who is originally from New York and whose Trump Tower resides within the Manhattan congestion zone, has been an outspoken critic, calling it a “disaster for NYC.” “I will TERMINATE Congestion Pricing in my FIRST WEEK back in Office!!!” Trump wrote in a May social media post. Michael Gerrard, a professor at Columbia Law School, told CNN that implementing congestion pricing before the January 20 presidential inauguration was key in protecting its viability. “In terms of what Trump can do, had congestion pricing not started before the inauguration, the Federal Highway Administration probably could have withdrawn its approval and prevented it from starting up,” Gerrard said. “But now that it’s started up, it’d be very tough for them to reverse themselves.” Gerrard, who was a member of the coalition of legal experts who sued New York Governor Kathy Hochul to reverse her decision in June to indefinitely halt congestion pricing, said he doesn’t expect other outstanding lawsuits against the MTA will have much success. “Congestion pricing lawsuits have been before four federal judges and two state judges. Only one of them has found any problems, and that was the need for a little more explanation on a couple of technical points,” Gerrard said. “The MTA will shortly be providing that explanation.” “If any judges thought there was a lot of merit to the challenges, they could have shut it down before it started,” he added. Columbia economist William Vickrey floated the concept of congestion pricing as early as the 1950s. In 2007, then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed a form of congestion pricing that was eventually killed. Proponents say it will reduce traffic and pollution while providing revenue for city projects. Meanwhile, critics say it is an unnecessary burden on drivers and will steer business away from the city. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, New York Rep. Mike Lawler and New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer have all been outspoken critics of congestion pricing, and over half of New York City voters disprove of the congestion pricing plan, according to a December poll. Kate Slevin, an executive vice president at the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group, told CNN that she thinks people will see benefits with time like less traffic on the roads and investments in public transit. “We desperately need greater investment in public transit. We have a terrible traffic congestion problem that is just getting worse every year, and everyone deserves cleaner air in our region, so this is a strong step towards addressing all those challenges,” Slevin said. New York City’s congestion pricing is the first of its kind in the United States. Yet congestion pricing has been implemented in cities across the globe for decades, including in Singapore since the 1970s, London since 2003 and Stockholm since 2007. Yonah Freemark, a researcher at the Urban Institute, said he expects public opinion in New York to improve over time. “London and Stockholm both indicate that public support for congestion pricing increases dramatically in the months after implementation as people become aware of the benefits,” he said. Passenger vehicles now pay once per day to enter Manhattan below 60th street; the charge is $9 during peak hours and $2.25 during off-peak hours. The MTA offers a 50% discount during peak hours for drivers with annual household incomes below $50,000. Single-unit trucks will be charged $14.40 during peak hours and $3.60 during off-peak hours for each trip into Manhattan below 60th Street. Peak hours are 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. Trump could have a hard time if he tries to reverse congestion pricing in his role as president as it has already largely been settled by the courts, according to Columbia Law School’s Gerrard. At this point, Gerrard said he thinks only Congress could really stop congestion pricing. Congress, which has a slim Republican majority, could get technically involved by threatening to withhold federal funds to the MTA. “It’s not inconceivable, but it would be extraordinary,” Gerrard said. There are other outstanding lawsuits, too. The United Federation of Teachers and the Trucking Association of New York previously filed lawsuits against the MTA, citing congestion pricing’s potential negative effects on low-income commuters who drive into the Manhattan congestion pricing zone. Only about 2% of residents in poverty in New York City’s outer boroughs would be affected by the congestion toll when driving to work, according to a 2022 study by the Community Service Center, a nonprofit. Meanwhile, about 61% of outer borough residents in poverty take public transportation into work. Roderick Hills Jr., a professor at the New York University School of Law, told CNN that lawsuits are unlikely to reverse the congestion pricing program now that it has begun. On January 3, a judge denied New Jersey’s last-ditch effort to halt the plan. “That, to me, is a pretty clear indication that the courts are not going to involve themselves to try to stop a program that has been litigated endlessly,” Hills said. Officials in other cities are watching what happens in New York. Along with New York, Chicago tops the list of the most traffic-congested cities in the US, according to INRIX, a transportation analytics company. Freemark said he has been aware of discussions about congestion pricing in cities like Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, DC, but “those discussions have not been particularly advanced.” Manny Gonzales, a spokesperson the for the Chicago Transit Authority, said in a statement that the CTA has been “closely watching how New York would implement congestion pricing.” “While CTA has not advocated for a congestion pricing solution like New York’s, it is the type of revenue stream that can generate significant amounts of funding that can directly improve public transportation systems in our region,” Gonzales said. “Eyes are on New York,” RPA’s Slevin said, as different cities gauge the public and legal response to congestion pricing in the coming months. Charles Komanoff, a transport economist and environmental activist, has been advocating for congestion pricing in New York City since the 1970s. He was among the crowd at East 60th Street on January 5 at 12:00 a.m. celebrating the start of the program after decades of debate. “Congestion pricing is going to begin to reset the relationship of New Yorkers to automobiles in a way that is going to be very exciting and enhancing and even liberating for the vast majority of people in the city of New York,” Komanoff said."
Will California homeowners relocate or rebuild? Both are costly,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/business/california-fires-homeowners-rebuild/index.html,"Tens of thousands of California residents will decide whether to permanently relocate or rebuild their homes after the most destructive fires in Los Angeles’ history. Insurance companies may cover thousands of dollars in temporary housing and living expenses — unless homeowners are underinsured or not covered. “The policy is generally going to cover the cost of additional living expenses while you are out of your home, to maintain what is kind of your usual standard of living,” said Karen Collins, the vice president of American Property Casualty Insurance Association’s property and environmental division. For example, if someone’s insurance covers $100,000 for a property, the insurance company might cover another $20,000 — or 20% — in additional living expenses, Collins said. Peter Vanek, president of PVRK, a Southern California-based real estate consulting company, said his home was destroyed by a battery fire in 2023. His insurance initially estimated $350,000 for the house. After Vanek provided evidence of what was lost, his insurance paid twice as much, including living expenses while he relocated, and the house was rebuilt. Insurance coverage plays an outsized role in the decision to move or invest resources into reconstruction. For some with insurance, it could boil down to having pictures of the property before the damages and updating insurers with home estimates. “(Homeowners) might not have disposable income to cover the difference between whatever their insurance is going to cover and what their cost is to rebuild their home, replace all of their items,” Vanek said. The current wildfires in Los Angeles County are the costliest and most destructive in its history. The insured losses could exceed $20 billion, according to a report by JPMorgan Chase. Between 2020 and 2022, insurance companies declined to renew 2.8 million homeowner policies in California, including 531,000 in Los Angeles County, according to data from the California Department of Insurance. Most of those policies were canceled by insurers. California Department of Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said Thursday that insurance companies must stop any pending non-renewals or cancellations for properties near the fires. “I am working on all fronts to make sure wildfire victims get the benefits they are entitled to, and they get it as soon as possible,” Lara said Friday in a statement. Moving isn’t necessarily easier than rebuilding. Moving locally typically costs between $884 and $2,569, according to digital marketplace﻿ HomeAdvisor. Mike Madowitz, principal economist at Roosevelt Institute, said many of those impacted by Hurricane Katrina chose to stay put after being displaced due to the cost and hassle of moving again. Most residents impacted by natural disasters don’t move, said Aaron Terrazas, a former chief economist for Glassdoor and senior economist at Zillow. He added that local economies receive a boost after natural disasters because residents purchase cars, washing machines and other goods when rebuilding. “But we shouldn’t be under any illusion that that’s a meaningful kind of growth for the economy,” Terrazas said. About 18% of the US labor force in 2023 were foreign-born, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And about a quarter of the construction industry are immigrant workers, especially in regions like Los Angeles, Terrazas estimated. Immigrant workers have flocked to places that were hit by natural disasters, such as New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and parts of Florida more recently, Terrazas noted. During the recovery period, these workers may work in construction or open small businesses. President-elect Donald Trump has proposed mass deportations, which could cause construction work to stall, Terrazas said. “Some of these kind of policies are a one-two punch for a sector like the construction industry,” he explained. And “it’s not just labor. It’s materials.” Imported materials, such as appliances, would cost more if Trump imposes more tariffs. Lumber, which had high prices due to previous Trump administration tariffs, could become even more expensive and businesses could mark up their costs as a result, said Madowitz of the Roosevelt Institute. Vanek of PVRK said independent contractors and home builders, not major companies, will primarily lead the construction efforts in California. “There’s no efficiency in rebuilding a fire-ravaged community,” he said."
Meta ends its DEI programs as Zuckerberg blasts Biden on Joe Rogan,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/tech/meta-ends-dei-programs/index.html,"Meta is ending its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, known as DEI, the company said Friday, becoming the latest company to pull back from such practices in the wake of pressure from conservative critics and customers. Meta is eliminating the company’s DEI team, ending “equity and inclusion programs and changing hiring and supplier diversity practices,” according to a company memo obtained by CNN and sent to all global employees by Meta’s vice president of human resources, Janelle Gale. A spokesperson for Meta confirmed the contents of the memo. “The legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing,” Gale wrote. “The Supreme Court of the United States has recently made decisions signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI. It reaffirms longstanding principles that discrimination should not be tolerated or promoted on the basis of inherent characteristics.” Gale also wrote that the term “DEI” has become “charged” because some believe it suggests “preferential treatment of some groups over others.” The memo was first reported by Axios. Meta’s chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams, will take on a new role focused on “accessibility and engagement,” the memo said. The company will also no longer require managers source candidates from unrepresented groups, and it will end efforts to hire minority-owned vendors and suppliers. “We build the best teams with the most talented people,” Gale wrote. “This means sourcing people from a range of candidate pools, but never making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender etc.),” Gale wrote. “Instead of equity and inclusion programs,” Gale wrote, Meta plans to build programs “that focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.” The end to the DEI programs dovetails with other major changes at the company that critics say cater to the right since President-elect Donald Trump won November’s election. Earlier this week Meta announced it was ending its third-party fact-checking programs in the United States and changing its hateful conduct policies, adding new types of content users can now post on Meta-owned platforms that were previously banned. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with President-elect Donald Trump on Friday at Mar-a-Lago, two sources familiar tell CNN. Meta declined to comment on the meeting between Zuckerberg and Trump. And Zuckerberg also appeared on the Joe Rogan podcast that same day, saying he’d been working on the changes announced this week “for a long time.” “The whole point of social media is giving people the ability to share what they want. It goes back to, our original mission is just give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected,” Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg said he’s been on a “journey” over the past decade, starting out “very pro-free speech, free expression,” but the 2016 victory of President Donald Trump and then pressure from the Biden administration to moderate Covid-19 misinformation on social media changed his view. “I kind of think in 2016 and the aftermath I gave too much deference to a lot of folks in the media who were basically saying ‘Okay, there was no way (Trump) could’ve gotten elected except for misinformation. People can’t actually believe this stuff,’” Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg said fact checking and content moderation got to the point that it “destroyed trust” in the platform. At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, Zuckerberg said Meta was heavily pressured by the Biden administration to remove content the administration saw as misinformation on the platform. “Basically these people from the Biden administration would call up our team and like scream at them and curse, and it’s like, these are documented, it’s all kind of out there,” Zuckerberg said, adding that the administration tried to get Meta to remove a meme that suggested people who get the Covid-19 vaccine would end up being part of class action lawsuits. “We’ve been pressure-tested on this stuff on the last 8 to 10 years with these huge institutions just pressuring us, and I feel like this is the right place to be going forward,” he said.

"These are the fastest-growing job titles, according to LinkedIn users",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/business/ai-hospitality-growth-linkedin/index.html,"Some of the fastest-growing jobs for 2025 barely existed at the turn of the century, according to a new analysis from LinkedIn. LinkedIn examined millions of jobs based on user updates from January 2022 to July 2024, determining noticeable growth in the artificial intelligence industry, as well as newfound interest in hospitality and travel. The top two jobs were artificial intelligence engineer and artificial intelligence consultant, respectively. Artificial intelligence has become the latest Silicon Valley buzzword as companies like OpenAI have released chatbots that can do everything from hold conversations to suggest recipes to remixing images — albeit with some occasional high-profile missteps. (Artificial intelligence researcher also nabbed the No. 12 spot.) But not all the jobs were AI-focused — or even high-tech. For example, the No. 3 job was physical therapist. Workforce development manager and travel advisor rounded out the top five. The professional social network bills its annual “Jobs on the Rise” list as a “roadmap” to the future of work. “From the rise of AI roles to the resurgence in travel and hospitality positions, the 2025 ranking highlights sectors with sustainable growth in today’s changing workforce,” the company wrote in its post. Meanwhile, major companies — including fast-food giant McDonald’s — have abandoned or downsized their DEI practices, and diversity and inclusion roles don’t seem to be growing as fast as previous years, according to LinkedIn’s report of user updates. From 2018 to 2022, diversity and inclusion managers were the third fastest-growing job title, and from 2019 to 2023, vice president of diversity and inclusion ranked seventh. In the latest report, the roles weren’t in the top 25 at all. LinkedIn also took note of the gender makeup of the 25 fastest-growing job titles. Of the top 10, security guards (67%), outside sales representatives (81%), artificial intelligence consultants (70%) and engineers (80%) were predominantly male roles. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the US economy added 256,000 jobs in December, far higher than the 153,000 jobs economists expected. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%, a sign of continued resilience in the labor market."
"Yes, a TikTok ban is closer than ever. No, your app probably won’t just disappear",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/tech/tiktok-ban-what-next/index.html,"TikTok’s fate in the United States is now in the hands of the Supreme Court. And things are not looking good for the app. The Supreme Court on Friday heard oral arguments over the law that could ban TikTok in the United States. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, requires TikTok to be sold off from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a US ban. The hearing did not seem to go well for TikTok, making it more likely than ever that the ban will go into effect starting on January 19. Most of the justices appeared likely to uphold the law, lobbing tough questions at lawyers for TikTok and its users about the relevance of their argument that the law violates the First Amendment. There are a lot of lingering questions about how the ban would work in practice because there’s no precedent for the US government blocking a major social media platform. And much of how the government plans to enforce it remains unclear. Even TikTok attorney Noel Francisco seemed uncertain about how exactly a ban would go down. “On January 19, as I understand it, we shut down,” he said. Beyond being unavailable in the app stores, “what the act says is that all of the other types of service providers can’t provide service either,” Francisco said. “So essentially what they’re going to say is that, I think, ‘we’re not going to be providing the services necessary to have you see it.’ So it’s essentially going to stop operating. I think that’s the consequence of this law.” TikTok itself said in its emergency filing to the Supreme Court that if the court doesn’t block the law, it “will take effect on January 19, 2025, shutting down TikTok for its more than 170 million monthly American users.” But some things are clear, including the fact that TikTok won’t suddenly disappear from existing users’ phones. Here’s what we know about how a ban would work. Technically, TikTok could take its ball and go home, blocking access to the app for American users itself, as a way of rebuking the US government and strengthening its bargaining position with the support of millions of newly irate people, bereft of their beloved TikTok. But given how hard it’s fought to avoid a ban, it’s more likely the US government will have to act to enforce the law. It is widely expected that the US government will force app store operators, like Google and Apple, to remove TikTok from their platforms. That would mean new users won’t be able to download it. TikTok’s existing American users could still use the app on their phones, but they won’t be able to update it via the app stores, meaning the company won’t be able to fix bugs or security holes. And either of those can add up, eventually making the app difficult — if not impossible — to use. “Potentially, vulnerabilities will become known in the app, and hackers will take advantage of those vulnerabilities to compromise your account or your device,” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNN’s Terms of Service podcast. .Still, it could be weeks or months before existing users see their experience on the app degrade. The government could also force American internet service providers (ISPs), which provide access to the internet and the websites on them, to block TikTok, making it impossible to access the web version of the platform. But that approach would be complicated, Galperin said, because there are many more ISPs than app stores. Regardless of the precise route the government takes to block TikTok, there will almost certainly be ways around it, for example, by using a virtual private network, or VPN. A VPN is a program anyone can download that can hide location data and make it appear as though the user is accessing the internet from a different country. “Many other countries have blocked social media apps and websites in the past using a variety of different methods, with a very wide range of results and levels of effectiveness,” Galperin said. “In Turkey, for example, a lot of social media sites have been blocked for years, and having a VPN that gets around that censorship is something that nearly every single person in Turkey does.” Even if the ban does go into effect, it’s not necessarily permanent. ByteDance would still have the option to sell the platform to a non-Chinese owner to restore access for American users. And there are willing buyers. A group created by billionaire Frank McCourt and backed by Shark Tank-famous investor Kevin O’Leary said Thursday they made a formal bid to ByteDance to acquire TikTok’s US assets, although the company has repeatedly said the app is not for sale. “When push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the government, told the Supreme Court Friday. “It might be just the jolt that Congress expected the company would need to actually move forward with the divestiture process.” President-elect Donald Trump’s promises to save TikTok have also added uncertainty to how a ban would unfold. Ahead of Friday’s Supreme Court hearing, Trump filed a brief urging the court to temporarily pause the ban’s implementation — currently set to begin one day before his inauguration — to give him time, as president, to negotiate a sale of TikTok. Legal experts have also suggested that Trump could simply choose not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they won’t be fined for continuing to host the app on their platforms. “It is possible that come January 20th, 21st, 22nd, we might be in a different world,” Francisco, TikTok’s attorney, said Friday, referencing the change in administration. It’s not clear, however, that those companies would be willing to violate the letter of the law, even with an assurance from Trump. “I am a little concerned that a suggestion that the president-elect or anyone else would not enforce the law, when a law is in effect and is prohibitive of certain action, that a company would choose to ignore enforcement on any assurance, other than a change in that law,” liberal-leaning Justice Sonia Sotomayor said during the hearing. “Whatever the new president does, doesn’t change that reality for these companies.”"

How to Trump-proof your portfolio,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/business/video/trump-proof-portfolio-egan-digvid,
Calling women ‘household objects’ now permitted on Facebook after Meta updated its guidelines,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/tech/meta-hateful-conduct-policy-update-fact-check/index.html,"Meta on Tuesday announced sweeping changes to how it moderates content that will roll out in the coming months, including doing away with professional fact checking. But the company also quietly updated its hateful conduct policy, adding new types of content users can post on the platform, effective immediately. Users are now allowed to, for example, refer to “women as household objects or property” or “transgender or non-binary people as ‘it,’” according to a section of the policy prohibiting such speech that was crossed out. A new section of the policy notes Meta will allow “allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality.” Previously, such comments would have been subject to removal under the policy. The changes to Meta’s hateful conduct policy were first reported by Wired. Meta had hinted in its announcement about its content moderation policy changes Tuesday morning that it would get rid of restrictions on certain topics, such as immigration and gender identity, and allow more political discussions. But the updated policy shows just how quickly Meta is moving to enact CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision for “free expression.” Meta on Tuesday also announced it would do away with its network of independent fact checkers in the United States and will instead rely on user-generated “community notes” to add context to posts. It also said it would adjust its automated systems that scan for policy violations, which it says have resulted in “too much content being censored that shouldn’t have been.” The systems will now be focused only on extreme violations such as child sexual exploitation and terrorism. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the new approach will mean “that we’re going to catch less bad stuff, but we’ll also reduce the number of innocent people’s posts and accounts that we accidentally take down.” A Meta spokesperson noted that the company will continue to prohibit attacks against certain groups, such as those based on ethnicity, race and religion, as well as prohibiting slurs, under the policy. And the spokesperson said that the company will continue enforce its policies against targeted bullying and harassment, as well as incitement of violence. The company’s Tuesday changes come as the company and its leader have sought to curry favor with Donald Trump and other Republicans ahead of the president-elect’s second term, echoing in its announcement longstanding criticisms that Meta was “censoring” conservative voices. Trump welcomed the changes in a press conference Tuesday and said he thinks the changes are “probably” due to threats he’s made to Zuckerberg in the past. But some experts who study the online information ecosystem raised alarms that the changes could lead to more viral false claims and hate speech on Meta’s platforms. Among the other changes to Meta’s hateful conduct policy, the company removed a prohibition against statements denying the existence of “protected” groups, such as statements that a certain group of people doesn’t or shouldn’t exist. The policy also now allows for content arguing in favor of “gender-based limitations of military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs.” The company also updated its “misinformation” policy to note the dissolution of its US-based fact-checking network."
US adds Chinese tech giants to list of companies allegedly working with China’s military,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/tech/tencent-catl-us-list-china-military-companies-intl-hnk/index.html,"The US Department of Defense has added Chinese tech companies Tencent, a social media and gaming giant, and CATL, the world’s largest battery maker, to a list of firms that it alleges work with China’s military. Inclusion on the Pentagon list does not result in any immediate sanctions, but it could affect the reputations of the companies named and hinder their commercial progress, particularly if they want to do business in the United States. Shares in Tencent, which owns Chinese super-app WeChat, were 6.5% lower in Hong Kong on Tuesday, while CATL’s Shenzhen-listed shares lost more than 3%. They join dozens of other alleged Chinese military companies on the list that the Defense Department alleges operate directly or indirectly in the US, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register on Monday. The Pentagon has said the so-called 1260H list, which is updated annually, is “an important continuing effort” in highlighting and countering China’s “military-civil fusion” strategy, a goal to develop the most technologically advanced military in the world by eliminating barriers between the country’s civilian research and commercial sectors and its armed forces. In a statement to CNN, Tencent called its inclusion on the list “a mistake.” “We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business. We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding,” a spokesperson said. CATL, which supplies batteries to Tesla and plans to provide its “knowledge” and services to Ford to make lithium-ion batteries at a plant in Michigan, said in a statement that it “has never engaged in any military-related business or activities, so this designation by the Department of Defense is a mistake.” “We will proactively engage with DoD to address the false designation, including legal action if necessary,” it added. A tech rivalry between Washington and Beijing has been escalating ahead of the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump later this month. Last week, Beijing said it was planning to curb the export of technology used to extract minerals critical for the growth of the global electric vehicle (EV) industry. In December, the outgoing Biden administration imposed fresh export controls on US-made semiconductors that Washington fears Beijing could use to make the next generation of weapons and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The US Commerce Department said the goal of the curbs was to slow China’s development of advanced AI tools that can be used in war and to undercut the country’s homegrown semiconductor industry, which it says threatens the national security of the US and its allies. Since coming to power in late 2012, China’s top leader Xi Jinping has unleashed sweeping reforms to transform the Chinese military into a world-class fighting force. A key part of that modernization drive has been to better integrate the country’s private sector and defense industrial base through the sharing of resources, talent and cutting-edge technologies. While efforts to break down barriers between China’s military and civil sectors date back to the 1990s, the military-civil fusion strategy has been increasingly promoted under Xi and elevated to a national strategy in 2014, as part of the leader’s vision to turn China into an economic, technological and military superpower. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is radically different from the US military, because it is the armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), said Isaac Stone Fish, CEO and founder of Strategy Risks, a business intelligence firm with a focus on China. “Beijing demands that its companies support the PLA,” he said. “US companies that have important partnerships with large Chinese companies, like Ford with CATL, need to understand that the regulatory, economic, and PR risks of these partnerships will continue to grow.” Ivan Su, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said that given Tencent’s business model, which focuses on social media and gaming, it “has a good chance to secure exclusion through US courts,” like Chinese consumer electronics maker Xiaomi managed to do in 2021 in a separate case. In January 2021, during the waning days of the first Trump administration, the Defense Department added Xiaomi to another list, under Section 1237, which subjected it to harsh restrictions, including a ban on American investment. Before the ban could take effect, a federal judge granted a temporary reprieve to the Chinese company by ruling that Washington lacked “substantial evidence” to support its claim that Xiaomi is owned or controlled by China’s military. In May of that year, the US Department of Defense and Xiaomi reached an agreement to set aside the ban."
The Washington Post lays off roughly 100 staffers as star journalists exit,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/media/washington-post-layoffs/index.html,"The Washington Post on Tuesday laid off roughly 100 employees across its business division, the latest indication of the newspaper’s financial woes after subscribers and staffers revolted over owner Jeff Bezos’s decision to block an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. The cuts amounted to roughly 4% of the publication’s staff and did not affect the newsroom, a spokesperson for the Post said. The news, which was first reported in the Status newsletter, comes as the beleaguered newspaper has hemorrhaged several high-profile journalists in recent weeks and top candidates pulled out of the running for the Post’s executive editor job. “The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are,” a Post spokesperson told CNN. “Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future.” The Post’s financial woes are nothing new. When Will Lewis, the Post’s publisher and chief executive, was named to the top job in November 2023, the storied paper was already reeling from the layoffs, readership decline, and high expenses that have hounded the entire industry. Yet, the extent to which the Post’s coffers had been sapped became apparent in May, when Lewis revealed the paper had lost $77 million in 2023. “To speak candidly,” Lewis said in a May meeting, “we are in a hole, and we have been for some time.” While Lewis offered a plan to right the ship at the time, the Post has since waded into deeper waters. Less than two weeks before the November election, Bezos, the billionaire Amazon founder who acquired the Post in 2013 for $250 million, blocked the paper’s endorsement of Harris, breaking with a decades-long tradition and resulting in the resignation of three editorial board staffers. At the time, Bezos defended the move, noting in an October op-ed that “presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election.” Speaking with Andrew Ross Sorkin at the Times’ DealBook Summit, Bezos said “it was the right decision,” adding that he was “proud” of the choice. “The advantage I bring to the Post is when they need financial resources, I’m available,” Bezos joked on stage. “I’m the doting parent in that regard.” While Bezos is not the only billionaire media owner to block an endorsement during the 2024 election cycle, the Post’s finances have suffered from the move. In the days after Bezos blocked the endorsement, over 250,000 Post readers canceled their subscriptions, roughly 10% of the paper’s digital subscribers. Inside The Post, the move ignited turmoil, leading to several recent high-profile defections. In December, Matea Gold, the Post’s managing editor, shared she was leaving the Post for The New York Times. Last week, The Atlantic poached political reporters Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, the Times scooped up White House reporter Tyler Pager, the Wall Street Journal nabbed investigative politics reporter Josh Dawsey, and Puck poached veteran journalist Leigh Ann Caldwell. And, on Friday, Ann Telnaes, the Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, very publicly resigned from the outlet after the newspaper refused to publish a satirical cartoon depicting Bezos bending the knee before Trump. The moves come as Bezos attempts to repair his relationship with the incoming president, dining last month with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and making a $1 million donation to his inaugural fund. On Sunday, Amazon said it would release a documentary about first lady Melania Trump on its Prime Video platform later this year. Melania Trump will serve as an executive producer of the project, signaling that the documentary is being made with her full participation — and editorial control."
Meta is getting rid of fact checkers. Zuckerberg acknowledged more harmful content will appear on the platforms now,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/tech/meta-censorship-moderation/index.html,"In a number of sweeping changes that will significantly alter the way that posts, videos and other content are moderated online, Meta will adjust its content review policies on Facebook and Instagram, getting rid of fact checkers and replacing them with user-generated “community notes,” similar to Elon Musk’s X, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Tuesday. The changes come just before President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office. Trump and other Republicans have lambasted Zuckerberg and Meta for what they view as censorship of right-wing voices. “Fact checkers have been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they’ve created,” Zuckerberg said in a video announcing the new policy Tuesday. “What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it’s gone too far.” Zuckerberg, however, acknowledged a “tradeoff” in the new policy, noting more harmful content will appear on the platform as a result of the content moderation changes. Meta’s newly appointed Chief of Global Affairs Joel Kaplan told Fox on Tuesday that Meta’s partnerships with third-party fact checkers were “well intentioned at the outset but there’s just been too much political bias in what they choose to fact check and how.” The announcement comes amid a broader apparent ideological shift to the right within Meta’s top ranks, and as Zuckerberg seeks to improve his relationship with Trump before the president-elect takes office later this month. Just one day earlier, Meta announced Trump ally and UFC CEO Dana White would join its board, along with two other new directors. Meta has also said it will donate $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, and that Zuckerberg wants to take an “active role” in tech policy discussions. Kaplan, a prominent Republican who was elevated to the company’s top policy job last week, acknowledged that the Tuesday announcement is directly related to the changing administration. He said that there’s “no question that there has been a change over the last four years. We saw a lot of societal and political pressure, all in the direction of more content moderation, more censorship, and we’ve got a real opportunity. Now, we’ve got a new administration, and a new president coming in who are big defenders of free expression, and that makes a difference.” Meta gave Trump’s team an advanced heads up that the moderation policy change was coming, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN. During a press conference Tuesday at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said he watched Kaplan’s appearance on Fox and said Meta has “come a long way.” “I watched their news conference, and I thought it was a very good news conference. I think they’ve, honestly, I think they’ve come a long way. Meta. Facebook. I think they’ve come a long way. I watched it, the man was very impressive,” Trump said in response to a question from CNN’s Steve Contorno. Contorno asked if Trump thought the decision by Meta was a direct response to threats Trump has made to Zuckerberg in the past. “Probably. Yeah, probably,” Trump said. Also following the announcement, Brendan Carr, who Trump has tapped to be chair of the Federal Communications Commission and who has railed on big tech companies over “censorship,” posted a gif of Jack Nicholson grinning and nodding in response to CNN’s Brian Stelter post on X with the news. The Real Facebook Oversight Board — an outside accountability organization, whose name is a play on the company’s official group, comprised of academics, lawyers and civil rights advocates including early Facebook investor Roger McNamee — said the policy changes represent Meta going “full MAGA.” “Meta’s announcement today is a retreat from any sane and safe approach to content moderation,” the group said in a statement, calling the changes “political pandering.” The moderation changes mark a stunning reversal in how Meta handles false and misleading claims on its platforms. In 2016, the company launched an independent fact-checking program, in the wake of claims that it had failed to stop foreign actors from leveraging its platforms to spread disinformation and sow discord among Americans. In the years since, it continued to grapple with the spread of controversial content on its platform, such as misinformation about elections, anti-vaccination stories, violence and hate speech. The company built up safety teams, introduced automated programs to filter out or reduce the visibility of false claims and instituted a sort of independent Supreme Court for tricky moderation decisions, known as the Oversight Board. Although Meta’s fact checking partners repeatedly said they checked claims from both the right and left, Trump supporters and other conservatives have long claimed that the system restricted their voices. “Anything I put on there about our president is generally only on for a few minutes and then suddenly they’re fact checking me saying this that and the other thing, which I know is not true. Their fact checker’s wrong,” one Trump supporter told CNN at a rally in 2020. But now, Zuckerberg is following in the footsteps of fellow social media leader Musk who, after acquiring X, then known as Twitter, in 2022, dismantled the company’s fact-checking teams and made user-generated context labels, called “community notes,” the platform’s only method of correcting false claims. Starting in the United States, Meta says it is ending its partnership with third-party fact checkers and instituting similar community notes across its platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Threads. “I think Elon has played an incredibly important role in moving the debate and and getting people refocused on free expression, and that’s been really constructive and productive,” Kaplan said. X CEO Linda Yaccarino responded to Meta’s move in an X post Tuesday, calling the community notes model “profoundly successful while keeping freedom of speech sacred. It’s a smart move by Zuck and something I expect other platforms will follow now that X has shown how powerful it is.” Musk himself called the Meta change “cool.” Meta also plans to adjust its automated systems that scan for policy violations, which it says have resulted in “too much content being censored that shouldn’t have been.” The systems will now be focused on checking only for illegal and “high-severity” violations such as terrorism, child sexual exploitation, drugs, fraud and scams. Other concerns will have to be reported by users before the company evaluates them. Zuckerberg said Tuesday that Meta’s complex systems to moderate content have mistakenly resulted in too much non-violating content being removed from the platform. For example, if the systems get something wrong 1% of the time, that could represent millions of the company’s more than 2 billion users. “We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship,” Zuckerberg said. But Zuckerberg acknowledged that the new policy could create new problems for content moderation. “The reality is this is a tradeoff,” he said in the video. “It means that we’re going to catch less bad stuff, but we’ll also reduce the number of innocent people’s posts and accounts that we accidentally take down.” The company is also getting rid of content restrictions on certain topics, such as immigration and gender identity, and rolling back limits on how much politics-related content users see in their feeds. As part of the changes, Meta will move its trust and safety teams responsible for content policies from California to Texas and other US locations. “I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams,” Zuckerberg said. This story has been updated with additional developments and context. – CNN’s Kate Sullivan contributed to this report."
Tesla under investigation for parking retrieval feature crashes,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/business/nhtsa-tesla-smart-summon-probe/index.html,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has launched an investigation into crashes It said occurred while Tesla vehicles were operating with a parking feature that allows owners to summon a car from a parking space without anyone being in the vehicle. The preliminary investigation, into an estimated 2.6 million Tesla vehicles with the “Actually Smart Summon” feature, was disclosed Monday. The agency said that it is aware of “multiple crash allegations” where the user was unable to prevent a collision, either due to line of sight or reaction time issues. It is the latest probe by the federal safety regulator into self-driving features of Tesla vehicles. It comes just two weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a major supporter of Trump during the campaign and since the election, starts to officially exert his influence over a wide range of federal government policy. Shares of Tesla have climbed more than 60% since the November election on investors’ belief that the Trump administration will follow policies that benefit Tesla, such as clearing the regulatory path to allow greater user of autonomous vehicles. In October NHTSA announced it had launched an investigation into the safety of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving feature, or FSD, after at least one fatal accident involving a pedestrian, as well as three other accidents, one of which involved an injury. The accidents involved in this latest investigation are by no means as serious. The agency said it had one accident reported to it by the car’s owner and at least three others in news reports. “All four incidents involve the subject Tesla vehicles operating in Actually Smart Summon failing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash,” said the statement from NHTSA disclosing the latest probe. It said it is also looking at 12 other incidents reported by car owners. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the probe. The company does not have a public relations staff and has rarely responded to requests for comments from outlets such as CNN. The Tesla website says that the feature is to only be used on private property, such as parking lots and driveways, not on public streets and roads. The site also says that the person operating the car using the feature on a phone app should have a clear view of the car and the path it’s following so they can stop the vehicle if necessary. While Teslas have had what the company refers to as “self-driving” options for years, those options include the warning that drivers must stay ready to take control of the car should the need arise to control accidents."
Target taps Tom Holland’s star power for Dry January,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/business/target-bero-tom-holland-distribution/index.html,"After successfully cornering the spirits section, celebrities now are aiming for the non-alcoholic aisle, with Tom Holland among the first A-listers making perhaps the biggest deal yet. Target announced Tuesday that Bero, Holland’s non-alcoholic beer brand, is coming to roughly 1,400 of its nearly 2,000 US stores this week, snagging a key display on an aisle endcap and giving further prominence to the growing sober-curious trend. Sales of non-alcoholic beer, spirits and wine at retailers jumped 27% last year, making it an $818 million category, according to NIQ. Non-alcoholic beer, the largest category of the three, raked in nearly $700 million in sales for the 52-weeks ending on December 21 — growing 25% compared to the same period a year prior. And the space is only forecasted to grow in light of trends shifting to more people either ditching or dialing back their drinking, especially younger customers. Last week, the US Surgeon General warned that alcohol is a “well-established, preventable cause of cancer” and suggested updated health warning labels on alcoholic beverages. Holland recently spoke candidly about his struggle with sobriety and creating the non-alcoholic beer Bero, which debuted last October, to feel included in social situations where drinking can be rampant, especially in his home country of the United Kingdom. Despite Holland’s star power, most recently with his revealing new photos for a Men’s Health cover story that set the internet on fire, the Target partnership solves a major grievance shared by his fans about the brand: It’s hard to find. “Since our launch, the only complaint that anyone has had has been that they really want local availability that they can go to the store instead of a website,” John Herman, Bero CEO and cofounder, told CNN. “We think that we have a good consumer base already that if we tell the story of ‘Hey, now they’re available at Target!’ we’re going to be able to mobilize them.” Target has been capitalizing on the non-alcoholic adult beverage trend for a few years already. In 2023, the chain partnered with Sèchey, an online retailer that sells alcohol-free spirits and wines, to add a selection of popular brands at 700 Targets. Adding Bero is Target’s “next step in owning this category,” according to Nate Rosen, a consumer packaged goods expert. He said that Bero’s premium packaging will help the beer stand out against its competitors. “The category has been pretty straightforward with Athletic Brewing doing most of the work getting consumers to understand what non-alcoholic beer can be, plus a couple of big brands like Heineken and Guinness,” Rosen, who writes the Express Checkout newsletter, told CNN. “But Bero’s positioning feels different: It’s more lifestyle-forward, which could help bring in people who might have overlooked non-alcoholic beer before.” Beyond Target, Bero is sold on its website, select retailers like Sprouts Farmers Market and Total Wine and More and at every Soho House US outpost. Bero’s Herman revealed that the beer will soon be sold on Amazon, which will help grow the fledgling brand in a competitive space dominated by well-entrenched companies that have large distribution. In 2024, Anheuser-Busch InBev was the biggest brewer of non-alcoholic beer, snagging 27% of sales in the category, according to exclusive data given to CNN from Fintech and the National Beer Wholesalers Association. Athletic Brewing is in second place (24.9% share of sales) and Heineken is in a close third at 23.5% share, per the data. (Bero sales weren’t available because it’s too new). All three companies are expanding in the space, too: Anheuser-Busch is soon rolling out Michelob Ultra Zero, capitalizing on the success of the low-carb beer and amid Bud Light’s sustained difficulties; Athletic is regularly releasing new versions and Heineken 0.0 is expanding distribution this year to convenience stores and will soon be sold in 12-packs. That’s a steep hill to climb, but Herman sees the space as an opportunity for Bero because it’s not an extension of an already existing beer and is crafting its own identity. “A lot of them are lacking that distinct perspective of who is the consumer and what is our reason for being,” he said, pointing to Bero’s positioning as being a premium alternative to his competitors. “We think that that’s going to allow for us to play in a very different space and ultimately expand the pie of the category.” Still, despite the excitement and growth of non-alcoholic options, it’s a small slice of overall booze sales: Those drinks currently account for just 0.7% of total alcohol sales at retailers, per NIQ’s analysis."
Waymo passenger nearly misses his flight after car drives in circles,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/business/waymo-circles-delay/index.html,"A Los Angeles tech entrepreneur found himself trapped in a self-driving taxi last month on his way to the airport, with the car repeatedly circling around a parking lot. Mike Johns posted a video on LinkedIn in which he was headed to Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix. Johns was still able to catch his flight but was left dizzy and frustrated by the experience with the taxi from Waymo, the self-driving car arm of Google’s parent company Alphabet. Waymo said the incident caused a five-minute delay. Johns told CNN on Monday that this wasn’t his first driverless taxi and wanted to give the service another shot for his ride to the airport. “It went into its first loop, second loop. What’s going on? I feel like I’m being pranked,” he said. By the fourth loop, he was starting to feel dizzy because it was a small, concentrated area. He wrote on LinkedIn that the car drove in eight circles. Johns said he didn’t contact customer support on his own. He said Waymo recognized the issue and contacted him through the car’s system. In the video, a Waymo employee is heard saying they called because of a notification that the car “might be experiencing some routing issue.” The Waymo representative can be heard telling Johns they couldn’t control the car themselves and needed him to use the app to resolve the issue. The representative then said they were trying to pull the car over and two screens in the car said it was “temporarily pausing” the ride and “finding a spot” to pull over. A Waymo taxi driving in circles isn’t the first time the technology has exhibited confusing behaviors or frustrated passengers and bystanders. In June 2024, Waymo recalled 672 cars to make them less likely to drive into poles after a car struck a pole in May. In 2021, the robotaxi was confused by puddles and riders said the cars were suddenly braking due to nearby birds. Waymo has also experienced multiple recalls, including in February 2024 when two vehicles hit the same truck minutes apart and Waymo, along with robotaxi company Zoox, became part of a federal investigation for erratic driving. Johns said he had heard about different incidents involving Waymo cars before. He didn’t necessarily think it would happen to him — until it did. Johns, an artificial intelligence consultant, said working in the technology industry was part of the reason he chose Waymo instead of rideshares Lyft and Uber. “It’s the future of where things are going so I’m definitely a part of that,” he said. Waymo completed a regularly scheduled software update after the looping event. Johns said he hasn’t been in contact with Waymo but may consider using the service again after talking to the company. Waymo told CNN in an email that it attempted to contact Johns and left a voicemail for follow-up."
Talks to avert another potentially crippling port strike set to resume,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/business/port-strike-negotiations/index.html,"Negotiations aimed at heading off a new strike at the ports up and down America’s East and Gulf Coasts are set to resume Tuesday. The talks are between the United States Maritime Alliance, the group representing ship lines and port and terminal operators which uses the acronym USMX, and the International Longshoremen’s Association, a union which represents 50,000 members who fill 25,000 jobs spread between three dozen locations at 14 port authorities from Maine to Texas. In October ILA members went on strike, stopping the flow of much of the cargo and containers over those docks. Those ports handle more than half of US inbound container traffic, and the strike threatened to create shortages of all manner of imports needed by US businesses and consumers, as well as hurt US exports. The strike ended after only three days though, when a tentative agreement sent workers back to the docks. That agreement covered only wages, which increased hourly pay by 10% in the first year and 62% over the six-year tentative deal. But it was silent on the issue of automation at the ports, a key issue in the strike. The members agreed only to go back to work through January 15, meaning a new strike could start on January 16 without a new contract or another contract extension. Neither the ILA nor USMX are commenting on where things now stand in negotiations, but the two sides have not met in person since mid-November. The key issue now being discussed involves the use of automation at the ports. Management argues it needs to introduce technology to improve productivity, not to eliminate union jobs, but the union is not convinced its members won’t be hurt by new technology. President Joe Biden had refused calls by many of the nation’s business groups to intervene and order the ILA members back to work during the October strike. It seems as if President-elect Donald Trump would also refuse to take the side of USMX and order the ILA back to work if a new strike starts and spills over into his tenure. After meeting with ILA President Harold Daggett in December, Trump came out firmly in favor of the ILA position on the issue of automation at the ports, writing on his Truth Social platform that the foreign-owned ship lines that dominate the USMX “have made a fortune in the US by giving them access to our markets…. I’d rather these foreign companies spend it on the great men and women on our docks, than machinery, which is expensive, and which will constantly have to be replaced.”"

Not using these job interview tips can reduce your chances of getting that job,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/04/success/job-interview-how-to-do-well-gen-z-wellness/index.html,"Megan Rathmell thought she’d bombed her job interview earlier this year, assuming her nervousness and lack of preparation had cost her the opportunity. The 20-year-old later found out she got the job as a paralegal — and what made her stand out was her ability to do two important things: maintain eye contact and carry on a conversation. “My boss told me that I was a good communicator and that I was able to make strong eye contact, and that he hasn’t seen this from a lot of my peers,” said Rathmell, who is based in Virginia. “That was really surprising to me.” What Rathmell learned from her boss mirrors what hiring managers say: Some Gen Z college graduates are unprepared for job interviews or behave unprofessionally during job interviews. They bring parents to in-person interviews, refuse to turn the camera on during virtual interviews, use inappropriate language, dress unprofessionally and struggle to make eye contact. While there have always been people who interviewed badly for jobs, “it does seem to be more prevalent today,” said Dr. Nathan Mondragon, chief innovation officer at the hiring platform HireVue. There could be several factors contributing to the problem. The digital age has made many people less experienced with in-person interactions and therefore less comfortable with them especially challenging ones. Pandemic safety precautions only made that worse, Mondragon said. And while some parents are overinvolved in their child’s professional pursuits, others aren’t teaching them how to navigate the professional world without parental handholding. Some people think they can just wing a job interview, said Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder. But just like anything else you want to be successful at, getting a job also requires preparation. There will be plenty of competition for those jobs, as new employment data released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday shows. The number of employed people increased by 254,000 in September, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%, according to BLS data on nonfarm payroll employment. (That excludes people working as farmers, nonprofit or private household employees, and more.) There are about 6.8 million people who currently want a job — so here’s what you should do before, during and after an interview to stand out and get the job you want. Before you get an interview, you need to stand out from hundreds of other applicants, and you have about six seconds to catch a recruiter’s eye using your resume, Haller said. Therefore, your resume should be one compelling, clear and uncrowded page that is tailored to the position and highlights why you’re the best candidate. Be careful who you get advice from, Haller said. If you know other people who work at the company or in similar industries, consulting them could be good. Parents and other people their age, however, likely have good intentions but may have not interviewed for a job in decades or ever worked in your industry, and the workforce is different now. Unless you’ve gone to a specialty school, your college or graduate school career center may not have employees with any experience in hiring people, so it’s not always helpful, Haller said. Look the career center employees up online to see if they have a relevant track record. Do your research One of the biggest mistakes some interviewees make is asking questions about things they could have easily found by looking at just the homepage of a company’s website, said Dr. Nicolas Roulin, professor of industrial/organizational psychology at Saint Mary’s University in Canada. That, as well as not asking any questions at all, tells the interviewer you haven’t done your homework and probably don’t care about the job. Thoroughly research the company, experts said. You must be able to answer the question, “Why do you want to work here?” and express how you can contribute to the company’s values, culture, strategies, goals and more. By researching the interviewers, as well — if you have their names — you can ask them more in-depth questions about their job, goals and lives, and you may even find you have a fun personal connection to bring up, such as having attended the same school. Websites such as LinkedIn or Glassdoor can help you find some of this information. Glassdoor reviews are typically left by current or former employees. Write down your answers in advance During the interview, you’ll also need to demonstrate how well you fit, and can perform, the job description. You can prepare by writing down your success stories for each requirement within that description, using the STAR technique. That acronym stands for situation, task, action and result — define the situation, what task needed to be accomplished, what actions you took alone or as part of a team to do so, and what the results were. Prepare your questions Your questions are just as important as your answers, and they should show interest, motivation and care, as well as what’s important to you, experts said. Here are some examples, which you can practice on your own or in mock interviews with friends or family: If you struggle with nervousness before interviews, relaxation or breathing techniques can help, Roulin said. Experiencing more severe anxiety may require therapy. Dressing professionally for both in-person and virtual interviews is important regardless of whether it’s for a fast-food restaurant, retail store or office job, experts said. Business casual is usually best — no jeans, shorts, flip-flops or overly revealing clothing. If the company culture is more casual, that doesn’t automatically mean you should dress like them for your interview, Haller said. Those employees have already had the chance to show over time that they do great work despite how they’re dressed, but they don’t know you yet. You need to make a good impression that shows you’re respectful and serious. At the same time, don’t go overboard by wearing a three-piece suit and appearing totally out of touch, Haller said — unless that’s the dress code. Bring all those notes you prepared to the interview, but don’t bring your parents. That can imply immaturity and incapability, and you’re the one who needs to be able to do the job without them. Where you do the interview is also important. The setting should be as distraction- and noise-free as possible, so avoid conducting it from a public space, such as a coffeeshop. Turning your camera off is generally inappropriate, experts said, and it can suggest you’re hiding something or uncomfortable dealing with people — which is obviously a concerning red flag since most jobs require dealing with people. READ MORE: Life lessons from 6 money and lifestyle coaches If you don’t have an answer for a question, ask the interviewer to rephrase or say “I don’t have much experience with that particular issue, but I can tell you about a time when X.” You can also say you would like an opportunity to really think about the question if they would let you get back to them with an answer. These alternatives show you’re adaptable, and they allow you to show off in other ways. When you’re given the chance to ask questions, ask what you’ve prepared. But save questions about salary, availability expectations and vacation benefits for a point towards the end of the interview, Mondragon said. These questions are important for your survival and quality of life, something Gen Z cares more about than previous generations — which is a great thing, he added. Some states, such as Colorado and New York, have even required that job postings state the salary. But you don’t want to appear to care more about not working than working. How you ask also matters. “Can you tell me about the company’s benefits packages for employees at this level?” sounds better than “How many days off do I get?” At the end, ask if there’s anything else you could provide to show you’re a great candidate for the position, Haller said. “You want to overcome any objections. And then you always want to ask about the next steps and express your interest.” Within 24 hours after the interview, email a thank you note expressing gratitude for the interviewer’s time and the opportunity, Haller said. But know that your message is more than a thank you note — it’s also an indirect reminder to hire you. If you get a call for another interview or a job offer, respond as immediately as possible, experts said. Even if you’re no longer interested, you should still quickly communicate that, too — it’s the respectful thing to do, and you don’t want to burn any bridges you may need to cross again in the future. Do not follow up with an employer about whether there’s any news before the time they said they’ll be in touch, Roulin said. After that is when you can check in once a week. If a month or two go by, no response from them is your answer, Haller said — and you shouldn’t work for companies that treat people that way.

Smart moves to make when the Fed starts cutting rates,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/success/fed-interest-rate-cuts-debt-savings/index.html,"Over the past couple of years, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its key interest rate to a 23-year high to beat down inflation. Now that inflation has slowed substantially and is expected to cool further, the central bank is expected to embark on a rate-cutting campaign over the next two years, starting as early as September. If it does, rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products for Americans, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts and certificates of deposit, among others. Given how many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response. The prospect of lower borrowing costs will be welcome news to those seeking loans or anyone trying to reduce their existing debt loads. But, realistically, how much you’ll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time. The answer for the near term is most likely to be “not that much.” “Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. By that he means: “Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],” McBride said. “And for savers, [the initial declines] won’t wipe out your interest earnings. Savers will still be way ahead of the game.” That’s because one or even two quarter-point rate cuts this year won’t meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs. But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then. “Don’t jump the gun too early on this stuff,” said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning. Here’s a breakdown of how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips from Diodato and McBride on what to do about it. Getting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people ever make. Mortgage rates are influenced by a number of economic factors, and the Fed’s moves are one. Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small cuts in interest rates could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay. For those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate. Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you may be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further. That’s because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance. To buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said. To refi, the costs could be higher — they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree. Given that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25% in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over 2% or 3%, Diodato sees it this way: “Buying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldn’t stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle. So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.” As for taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that it’s no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%. A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed won’t make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said. “Americans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it. Just because you have equity doesn’t make it free money.” Of course, if you’re just taking out a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern. But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted. And if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, “aggressively pay it down. It’s high-cost debt that won’t get cheaper soon.” Another perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balances. A few rate cuts won’t make much of a dent in today’s record-high average rate of 20.7%. Even if rate cuts ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 — 16.3% — it will still be a pricey loan. That’s why, if you’re carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe. If that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks. “They typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,” Dodiato said. If you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think. McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car. So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year. “Your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much you’re financing and your credit rating,” he said. As for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called “money factor” you will pay to lease, and because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates. The past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts, many of which have been paying north of 5%. The same goes for those who could lock up their cash for certain periods of time in certificates of deposits or Treasuries, many durations of which were also paying north of 5%. While those rates will start to come down when the Fed starts cutting rates, the drops aren’t likely to be huge at first — meaning you will still be able to earn more on your savings than the rate of inflation for a while, McBride predicts. But it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward. “I caution people against the cash trap. A lot of people, used to these nice savings rates, were diverting money from stocks and longer-term bonds,” said Diodato, who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to 3% in the next two years. His advice: Don’t keep more than six months’ to a year’s worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents. “Anything more than that and you’re putting a drag on your future net worth,” he said. That said, McBride suggested that if you’re within five years of retirement, you might want to lock in some high rates still on offer today to grow the cash you’ll want to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working. Having that cash on hand means you won’t be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big market downturn at the start of your retirement. For instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com. If you do opt for such a longer-term CD, try to find one that is not “callable.” A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years. “The call feature is a ‘Heads I win, tails you lose’ for the issuing bank,” McBride said."
Early signs of dementia can show in your finances,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/08/success/money-problems-dementia/index.html,"Financial files in disarray. Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices. Multiple daily bank withdrawals. Out-of-character purchases. When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed dementia. Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person’s average credit scores may start to weaken and their payment delinquencies rise. “The harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,” the researchers wrote. “Beyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.” Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are “not remotely shocking.” Tidwell’s mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since. Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an “outrageously methodical human being” who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military. After going through her mother’s papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother’s memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became “less than pristine.” For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register. But that register became a mess. “There was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding — she knew things weren’t all they could be. Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.” Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers. Her father was a former finance executive who “was very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,” she said. And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest. Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card. He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn’t need, just months before police took away his driver’s license. Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said. What’s more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes. So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties. “I spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn’t paid them,” Lemay said. Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia. Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it. Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care. “The most challenging thing we faced was managing mum’s everyday money as her condition progressed. She would overspend on things she didn’t need or want. Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food. She also fell victim to scams over the phone — a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,” Sibley said. Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked. Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father’s situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care. While her mother’s condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own. In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties. To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week’s worth of cash for their mother “but she’d spend it all in one go,” she said. Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes. Eventually, they took away her cash card. But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said. “She wasn’t able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections. That’s when we realized there has to be a better way.” With her husband, she founded Sibstar, which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement. When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app. As a person’s condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store). While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person’s finances when they become incapacitated. In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise. That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother’s bank account to make sure nothing was amiss. By 2020, she had automated her mother’s bill paying online. “The time to make plans is before you need to. It’s hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to ‘future me,’” said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother’s finances now that her condition has worsened considerably. Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US National Institute on Aging recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia. Of course, no amount of advanced financial planning can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline. “I prepared as best as I could, but it’s still hard,” Tidwell said. That’s why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, “make the easy part easy.”"
Steps you can take now to avoid college sticker shock,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html,"Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn’t be any different than shopping for a home. When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family’s needs and fall within your price range. “Adopt a mindset that we’re buying college like we’re buying a house,” said Beth Walker, author of “Buying College Better” and “Never Pay Retail for College.” As a financial adviser and certified college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies — and gets into — schools they cannot afford because the schools won’t give them enough aid. And then they just … try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family — so parents don’t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn’t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child’s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one “where a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.” In helping families align parents’ affordability constraints with their student’s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn’t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won’t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don’t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you’re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child’s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don’t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). “If you’re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don’t blow up your retirement,” he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you’re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child’s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you’re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don’t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt — including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans — to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. “If folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.  For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,” Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. “The student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,” Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum’s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you‘ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended “safety” schools or “reach” schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge how competitive their profile is at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn’t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: “We have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.”"
They built careers on TikTok. Now they’re bracing for a possible ban,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/tech/tiktok-creators-influencers-ban/index.html,"Joanne Molinaro’s life changed when she found TikTok. She had clawed all the way up to being a partner at a big Chicago law firm after more than a decade of working in corporate litigation. And it nearly crushed her. “I was thinking to myself … lucky me to have this job that pays my bills,” Molinaro said in an interview with CNN’s Terms of Service podcast. “And so what if it’s soul-sucking and it makes me want to curl up at night into fetal position and cry? That’s okay because this is what adults do.” Like many people who were bored at home in the pandemic spring of 2020, Molinaro downloaded TikTok for fun. She mainly watched other people’s videos, although she also posted some cooking videos of her own. But then, one of her videos unexpectedly went viral. Just over a year later, Molinaro withdrew from partnership at her firm to go full-time as a TikTok creator. She’s since built a brand around her profile, @TheKoreanVegan, publishing a cookbook with the same name and racking up more than 3 million followers across TikTok and Instagram. Molinaro is just one of many TikTok influencers who are now bracing for a possible ban of the app in the United States — and the loss of her six-figure income that could come with it. A US law that could ban TikTok is set to go into effect on January 19, unless the app is sold or the law is blocked by the Supreme Court. On Friday, the Supreme Court is heard oral arguments on TikTok’s legal challenge to the law, which the company claims violates its First Amendment rights and those of its 170 million American users. The US government has argued that the app poses a risk to national security because its parent company, ByteDance, is based in China. “TikTok collects vast swaths of data about tens of millions of Americans, which the (People’s Republic of China) could use for espionage or blackmail,” the US Justice Department stated in a legal filing to the Supreme Court. “And the PRC could covertly manipulate the platform to advance its geopolitical interests and harm the United States.” The court appeared likely to uphold the law and allow the ban to go into effect, with both liberal and conservative justices directing a series of tough and skeptical questions at lawyers for TikTok and the app’s users. Several key justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, worried about the potential national security concerns that two presidents have raised about the platform. Historically, the court has deferred to the other branches of government on matters of national security. “Are we supposed to ignore the fact that (TikTok’s) ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?” Roberts said. And during more than two hours of arguments, many of the justices appeared to view the sell-or-ban law not primarily as one with First Amendment implications, but rather an effort to regulate foreign control of popular app. But TikTok lawyer, Noel Francisco, repeatedly argued that the law violates its free speech rights, and that separating TikTok’s US presence from ByteDance is an unreasonable solution. “Any new TikTok would be a fundamentally different platform with different content, which is yet another reason why I think this is a content-based restriction that falls directly on TikTok,” Francisco said. Many TikTok users aren’t concerned by the Chinese government, at least if the revenue they generate is any indication. By TikTok’s own estimate, the 7 million US small businesses that use the app stand to lose $1 billion in revenue, and around 2 million creators would suffer $300 million in lost earnings in just one month, if the app is banned. “A TikTok ban would be absolutely catastrophic for the creators and the small businesses who rely on it,” said Jess Maddox, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who researches social media and internet culture. “I’ve spent my career talking to creators and influencers, they are resilient, they’ll pivot, but it will be a struggle in the meantime and take a hit to them financially.” TikTok’s popularity skyrocketed in 2020 thanks in large part to its unique algorithm, which prioritizes showing users entertaining content whether or not it’s from an account they follow. It was unlike older mainstay platforms’ feeds, which had largely been based on reinforcing existing social connections. Users flocked to the app, as did creators, who found it far easier to quickly build an audience and discover almost overnight success if they correctly predicted what the algorithm would want. That’s what happened to Eli Rallo, who downloaded the app in 2020 as a senior in college, stuck at home because of Covid-19. “I was messing around with my brothers one night… in our kitchen. And I made a video of us filling up a jar of snacks with trail mix and I put music behind it. It was kind of random, very Gen Z humor-esque,” Rallo told CNN. “And the next day it had, like, 200,000 views. I was shocked. And then I just started to make videos from there.” Social media has been Rallo’s full-time job since October 2021; she now has more than 1 million followers across TikTok and Instagram and is in the process of writing her second book. “My career just simply would not be where it is today without TikTok,” she said. Rallo says she now regularly inks five-figure deals with brands to promote their products on TikTok. She’s part of the “creator economy” that Goldman Sachs has estimated could be worth $480 billion by 2027. But she’s worried that could change if the app is banned. “I am very concerned, if I’m being honest, about what would happen because I do think my financial situation would change,” she said. “I’m very lucky that I make money from my books, and I’m very lucky that I make money from brands on Instagram. I think we would see an uptick in deals on Instagram, but the TikTok money is definitely the bulk of my income.” Molinaro said she’s already seeing the financial impact of a potential ban, starting back in April when President Joe Biden signed the sale-or-ban law. In 2024, Molinaro estimates she took in 30% less money from sponsors. “Those brands are not willing to spend dollars right now because they’re terrified. ‘Oh, why would I spend money on a campaign that’s going to just fall flat on its face in a few days?’” she said. “That has directly impacted me, and I’m sure it’s impacted a lot of influencers.” A TikTok ban could boost competitors like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. But for people who make earn their income on TikTok, it may be difficult to shift to depending entirely on those other platforms. It can take time to build up a following on other apps large enough to draw big sponsorships, as their TikTok followers may or may not follow them. And other platforms’ algorithms often prioritize different things — maybe longer videos or certain kinds of music — and it can take time for people to adjust their strategies. “It’s not the same technology. It’s not the same type of user. It’s not the same culture,” Maddox said. And a ban could have ripple effects beyond individuals on TikTok. Many influencers employ teams to support their careers, such as agents, accountants and lawyers to review brand deals. “Many people think, oh, a TikTok ban is going to mean these glamorous, frivolous influencers are going to have to get real jobs,” Maddox said. “Yes, there’s the top 1% that is making a lot of money and living a very glamorous lifestyle. But the reality is the people who are going to be most hurt by a TikTok ban are those staunchly middle-class Americans who are using this for information, for entertainment, to grow their business, their following, and grow their community.” For now, Rallo and Molinaro say they’re working to diversify their businesses and grow their followings elsewhere, including other social platforms or email newsletters. “Social media, somebody once described it to me, it’s like building real estate on sand. You never know,” Molinaro said. –CNN’s John Fritze contributed to this report."
‘Shark Tank’s’ Kevin O’Leary and billionaire Frank McCourt want to buy TikTok. One problem: It’s not for sale,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/tech/tiktok-ban-buy-frank-mccourt-kevin-oleary-bytedance/index.html,"A group formed by billionaire entrepreneur and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt has made a formal offer to buy TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance. The group, which calls itself The People’s Bid for TikTok and is also backed by “Shark Tank”-famous investor Kevin O’Leary, said Thursday it had delivered a proposal to ByteDance to acquire TikTok’s US assets. It did not disclose the value of the offer. The bid comes just one day before the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments over whether to uphold a law that would ban TikTok in the United States starting January 19 if it is not sold, following a legal challenge from the social media company. But the proposal could face a major problem: ByteDance has repeatedly said TikTok’s not for sale. After President Joe Biden signed the law that could ban the app in April, ByteDance swatted down speculation that it was exploring a sale and said that it had no plans to sell TikTok. In a filing to the Supreme Court — which argues that the law would violate the first amendment rights of the platform and its users — the company said the law “will take effect on January 19, 2025, shutting down TikTok for its more than 170 million monthly American users.” TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the McCourt group’s bid. TikTok is the first Chinese social media app to become a global success that competes with American tech giants. The People’s Bid is backed by investment firm Guggenheim Securities, as well as technologists and academics, including world wide web inventor Tim Berners-Lee. And McCourt said the group plans to work with President-elect Donald Trump to close the deal. The group’s plan is to buy the US version of TikTok without its famous algorithm and rebuild it on American-designed technology, a likely response to a Chinese export control rule requiring a license to sell sensitive technologies. China’s commerce ministry previously said it would “firmly oppose” a forced sale of TikTok. That effort would “minimize interruption for TikTokers and prioritize privacy and trust on the platform,” the group said in a statement. “By keeping the platform alive without relying on the current TikTok algorithm and avoiding a ban, millions of Americans can continue to enjoy the platform,” McCourt, who formed the group through his organization dedicated to improving the internet, Project Liberty, said in a statement Thursday. “We look forward to working with ByteDance, President-elect Trump, and the incoming administration to get this deal done.” But many users and social media experts have questioned whether a sale that excludes the algorithm could be successful, given that the technology that decides what users see on their “For You” feeds is a major reason for the app’s popularity. Other tech giants have struggled to replicate it. “We want to eliminate the misconception that it can’t sell because no one will buy it without the algorithm. NOT true,” O’Leary said in an X post Wednesday, after announcing he was joining the bid to buy the app earlier this week. “We’ll buy it without the algorithm. We don’t need them. We’ll do it ourselves and make TikTok wonderful again.”"
"UFC head Dana White joins Meta’s board, Mark Zuckerberg’s second key right-wing appointment in a week",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/06/tech/ufc-dana-white-joins-meta-board/index.html,"Meta has named three new members to its board of directors, including Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive who played a key role in the reelection of his longtime friend, President-elect Donald Trump. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced White’s appointment — along with Charlie Songhurst, a tech investor who has been advising Meta on artificial intelligence, and John Elkann, CEO of Exor, a holding company that owns several automotive and other brands — in a Facebook post Monday. “We have massive opportunities ahead in AI, wearables, and the future of social media, and our board will help us achieve our vision,” Zuckerberg said. The new additions bring the social media giant’s board to 13 directors, including Zuckerberg. White’s appointment is particularly notable as it comes amid a broader apparent ideological shift to the right within Meta’s top ranks, and as Zuckerberg seeks to improve his relationship with Trump before the president-elect takes office later this month. White stumped for Trump on the 2024 campaign trail, praised him at the Republican National Convention and walked alongside him at a November UFC match at Madison Square Garden following the election. White also used his connections to leverage appearances for Trump on friendly, right-leaning podcasts with millions of young, male listeners, although the UFC boss told the New Yorker in November that he, “want[s] nothing to do with politics” anymore. White is also a leader of one of Zuckerberg’s favorite pastimes: competitive fighting. Zuckerberg has sparred with UFC professionals; in November of 2023, he tore his ACL training for an MMA fight. Zuckerberg also agreed to cage fight X owner Elon Musk, although that battle never materialized. “I love social media. And I’m excited to be a small part of the future of AI and emerging technologies,” White said in an Instagram post announcing his appointment to the board. Last week, Meta’s President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg, the company’s top policy executive, announced he was stepping down and passing the baton to his deputy, Joel Kaplan, one of Meta’s most prominent Republican leaders. Kaplan, who held several key roles, including deputy chief of staff for policy, in President George W. Bush’s White House before joining Meta in 2011, is “clearly the right person for the right job at the right time,” Clegg said in his announcement. Meta has said Zuckerberg wants to take an “active role” in tech policy conversations with the incoming Trump administration. Like other CEOs, Zuckerberg met with Trump at the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago resort following the election and Meta donated $1 million to his inaugural fund. In recent years, Meta also rolled back some election-related content moderation efforts, such as allowing users to post claims of voter fraud and political ads that question the outcome of the 2020 election — a move welcomed by Republicans who had accused the company of “censoring” conservative voices. In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee over the summer, Zuckerberg also stated that the Biden administration had “pressured” Meta to “censor” content during the pandemic, a statement that was quickly used by Trump to once again promote the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen."
The New Orleans attacker wore Meta glasses. What can they be used for?,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/06/tech/meta-glasses-new-orleans-attack/index.html,"The attacker who drove a truck through New Orleans’ Bourbon Street on New Year’s Day used Meta smart glasses to scout the scene weeks earlier, according to the FBI. Shamsud-Din Jabbar stayed at a rental home in New Orleans beginning October 30 and wore the smart glasses to record video while he bicycled through the French Quarter, said Lyonel Myrthil, the FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge. Jabbar wore them again on New Year’s Day but did not activate them that day. “Jabbar was wearing a pair of Meta glasses when he conducted the attack on Bourbon Street, but he did not activate the glasses to livestream his actions that day,” Myrthil said on Sunday at a press conference. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment to CNN. Meta released its smart glasses in 2021 in collaboration with Ray-Ban, called Ray-Ban Stories. The Meta smart glasses are priced as high as $379, according to the Ray-Ban website, and can be purchased at Best Buy, Target and T-Mobile, among other retailers. Meta smart glasses — which are part of a wider industry push to make hands-free, wearable technology the next big computing platform — can take photos and use artificial intelligence to answer user questions about their surroundings. Meta also included a feature so bystanders know when a user takes a photo or shoots a video: a small, front-facing LED light that shines white when the camera is operating. Meta in September teased a new, more advanced version of the glasses, called Orion, that incorporate augmented reality technology, allowing users to see holograms, such as text messages or emails, floating in space around them. The AR glasses were made available to Meta employees and some users outside of the company as Meta develops a consumer version, according to the company’s announcement. The HD cameras built into the glasses can take photos and record videos for up to three minutes. These photos and videos can then be automatically imported to the Meta View app on users’ smartphones, if the feature is turned on, or manually imported. To take photos, users can click a capture button on the side of the glasses frame. If voice controls are enabled, users can take a photo or begin recording hands-free, according to the company’s website. By saying, “Hey Meta,” which is the device’s “wake word,” users can tell the glasses to begin recording. The glasses can also livestream by connecting Facebook or Instagram accounts to Meta View. Once connected, users can switch between cameras by double-pressing their glasses’ photo capture button. Meta’s smart glasses can be voice controlled in select countries, only when speaking English, to ask the built-in AI questions. In a video posted by Best Buy, a user says, “Hey Meta, look and translate this sign,” to which an AI voice responds that it welcomes visitors and asks for help protecting the area. It’s not clear if the wake word can be changed by the user, but users can ask follow-up questions without the wake word by turning on the feature in Meta View. Meta’s website explains the glasses won’t react if “we detect speech not intended for your glasses” and, if someone is using another feature that uses the microphone, the glasses “will not be listening for your follow-up request.” Users can turn on voice storage and, if there are “misactivations” — in which the user didn’t intend to trigger voice controls — recordings and transcripts will be deleted “within 90 days of detection.” The glasses have a built-in speaker on the frames that plays music, AI and phone audio. The website also has a section that includes tips like, “respect people’s preferences,” “power off in private spaces,” and “be a good community member,” where it says: “Obey the law. Don’t use your glasses to engage in harmful activities like harassment, infringing on privacy rights, or capturing sensitive information like pin codes.” The glasses have two lights: an inward-facing LED to notify users that capture, voice control and call may be in use and an outward-facing capture LED to let others know when the glasses are turning on and taking photo or video. “If the capture LED is covered, you’ll be notified to clear it before taking a photo or video or going live,” Meta says on the website. But Meta’s recommendation that the glasses shouldn’t be used to invade others’ privacy hinges on the users themselves taking heed of that request."
"Disney, WBD, Fox pull plug on Venu Sports streaming service before launch",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/media/venu-sports-disney-wbd-fox-discontinue/index.html,"Venu Sports, the joint streaming service from Warner Bros. Discovery, Fox Corp., and Disney, has been discontinued before its launch, the trio announced in a surprise move Friday morning. The decision, made collectively by WBD, Fox, and Disney, is effective immediately. “After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service,” the trio said in a joint press release. “In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels.” The decision to terminate Venu comes four days after Disney announced its Hulu + Live TV service would merge with Fubo, ending the latter’s lawsuit that had for months hampered the fraught sports streaming venture’s launch. While Disney’s Fubo deal appeared to pave the way for Venu’s launch, reports emerged on Thursday that satellite TV providers DirecTV and Dish had likewise asked a judge to reconsider dismissing Fubo’s case, signaling further delays in the platform’s launch. Fubo declined to comment for this story. “DIRECTV remains a leader in sports, and we look forward to working with our programming partners – including Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery – to compete on a level playing field to deliver sports fans more choice, control, and value all-in-one experience,” a DirecTV spokesperson told CNN. Legacy media companies have been working for years to transition away from relying on the traditional cable bundle and toward profitable streaming services as millions of consumers cut the cord each year, a migration prompted by the rapid rise of Netflix. WBD (CNN’s parent company), Fox, and Disney first revealed plans to launch Venu Sports last February, saying at the time that the super-streamer would launch in fall 2024. The companies initially marketed the platform as a single destination for sports fans to find a wide array of content in an otherwise kaleidoscopic market that has increasingly carved up sports franchises across an array of cable and streaming platforms. Venu Sports would have housed the trio’s respective sports portfolios in a single platform — including NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, FIFA World Cup games, NASCAR races, UFC matches, and PGA TOUR golf tournaments. In August, Fubo filed a lawsuit blocking the platform’s launch, alleging at the time that WBD, Fox, and Disney were using their sports media rights to slip by the competition in a single anticompetitive bundle. To settle the lawsuit, Disney, Fox and WBD said Monday they would pay Fubo $220 million, and Disney would provide a $145 million loan to Fubo through 2026. While Venu’s launch looked increasingly unlikely in recent months, Disney has touted its yet-to-launch flagship ESPN streaming platform as a viable recourse. But Disney’s deal with Fubo on Monday gave the appearance that the Magic Kingdom was hedging its bets on its ESPN platform. Venu’s dissolution will now likely see Disney double down on its ESPN streamer, which is set to launch later this year."
Hoda Kotb signs off from NBC’s ‘Today’,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/media/hoda-kotb-today-show-farewell/index.html,"Hoda Kotb, the co-host of NBC’s “Today,” signed off Friday, ending a nearly two-decade long run with the morning show. As part of her send-off, the program showed a retrospective of her time with “Today,” filled with memories from her co-anchors, including Savannah Guthrie, Craig Melvin, Al Roker and Carson Daly. Holding back tears, Kotb responded “Can I just say thank you? I have not been able to articulate it because I’m a mess most of the times.” She complimented everyone, calling Guthrie “her person,” and Roker “my first friend” at the show, as well as labeling Daly the show’s “secret sauce.” Kotb told Melvin that he’s earned his new co-anchor position and joked that she will be “dead asleep” on Monday when he starts. “Today” also surprised her with some of her favorite people like Maria Shriver and Simone Biles, who said she will see Kotb in Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics. Kotb’s kids also joined her, along with Kermit the Frog, who said Kotb’s smile is his favorite thing about her. Kotb has co-hosted the program with Guthrie since 2018, taking over from Matt Lauer, who was fired following allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior at work. Prior to her promotion, she formally joined “Today” in 2007 to co-host the fourth hour. A year later, Kathie Lee Gifford joined, propelling the hour into the pop culture pantheon with their booze-induced antics. Since joining in 1998 as a correspondent for “Dateline,” Kotb has become one of the most recognizable faces on NBC. Her warmth and kind personality has resonated with viewers who flocked daily to 30 Rockefeller Center in New York to meet her. That was evident on her final day, with the crowd outside the “Today” studios filled with die-hard Kotb fans for the “Hoda-bration” and holding signs declaring their love for her. Kotb quipped that she was going to “save every single sign.” Kotb, 60, shocked fans in September when she announced her departure, saying it was the “hardest decision of her life.” She has two young daughters and wants to spend more time with them. In addition to anchoring the first two hours, Kotb hosted the fourth hour with Jenna Bush Hager. That will be rebranded next week as “Jenna & Friends,” featuring a stint of guest co-hosts — including actors Keke Palmer, Eva Longoria and Scarlett Johansson — until a permanent co-host is named. NBC previously announced that Melvin will take over Kotb’s position. He begins his new co-anchor role with Guthrie on Monday and will continue to co-host the third hour. Kotb’s exit represents one of the biggest changes to the morning television landscape in at least a decade. Shows like “Today” and ABC’s “Good Morning America” are highly profitable parts of their parent companies and are cultural icons, even as the broadcast business shrinks overall."
"Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corp. must face 2020 election defamation lawsuit, appeals court rules",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/media/fox-corp-smartmatic-election-lawsuit-murdoch/index.html,"A New York appeals court ruled Thursday that Fox Corporation must face Smartmatic’s mammoth defamation lawsuit over the airing of 2020 election lies on Fox News, dealing a blow to the Rupert Murdoch-controlled media giant. Smartmatic, the voting technology company that Fox News guests and hosts falsely accused of rigging the 2020 election, sued both Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corp in 2021. As part of its lawsuit, Smartmatic alleged that Rupert Murdoch and his eldest son, Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch, directed the cable network to embrace a “disinformation campaign to win back its audience” after Joe Biden won the election. The latest ruling represents a key victory for Smartmatic’s efforts to go after the right-wing media outlet over its promotion of debunked claims that the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. The Fox entities have denied wrongdoing. “We will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial,” a Fox spokesperson said in a statement responding to the ruling. “As a report prepared by our financial expert shows, Smartmatic’s damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on their face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms.” Both Fox News and Fox Corp. have mounted multiple unsuccessful efforts to dismiss the massive defamation lawsuit, which was filed in New York state court. In its ruling Thursday, the unanimous New York appeals court cited, in part, similar legal findings from the Delaware judge who oversaw a related case brought by Dominion Voting Systems over Fox’s airing of 2020 election lies. Fox paid more than $787 million to settle that lawsuit in 2023, in the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history. “Here, consistent with the Dominion decisions, we find that the allegations in the first amended complaint relating to Fox Corporation directing the other defendants to undertake a disinformation campaign… sufficiently allege Fox Corporation’s ‘direct liability’ for the challenged defamatory statements,” the New York appellate ruling said. The lawsuit is still in the discovery phase but could head to trial later this year, unless there is an out-of-court settlement, as is common in media defamation cases. A lawyer for Smartmatic, Erik Connolly, hailed the ruling in a statement. “The New York Supreme Court rebuffed Fox Corporation’s latest attempt to escape responsibility for the defamation campaign it orchestrated against Smartmatic following the 2020 election,” Connolly said. “Fox Corporation attempted, and failed, to have this case dismissed, and it must now answer for its actions at trial.” The decision comes after Fox Corp. was dealt another consequential legal setback. Last month, a Delaware judge ruled that major Fox shareholders — New York City’s pension funds and the state of Oregon — can move forward with their lawsuit alleging that the company board of directors failed to protect investors by allowing Fox News to spread lies about the 2020 election, which led to defamation lawsuits. Citing evidence from the Dominion case, the judge said the lawsuit “sufficiently pleads that Murdoch faces a substantial likelihood of liability for consciously causing or willfully allowing Fox News to broadcast defamatory content.”"
"Fact-checkers, targeted by MAGA loyalists, blast Zuckerberg’s assertion their work was ‘biased’",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/media/fact-checkers-meta-zuckerberg-facebook-bias/index.html,"Meta’s surprise decision to scrap its fact-checking partnerships – blindsiding journalists involved in the program and putting some out of work – is part of a much bigger shift in media and politics. The very notion of fact-checking is under assault by a wide array of fact-challenged politicians and interest groups. Particularly on the right, “fact-check” has been turned into a dirty word, one that presupposes the fact-checker is actually suppressing some inconvenient truth. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg played right into that assumption on Tuesday when he insulted fact-checkers as “too politically biased” and said they “have destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the U.S.” Destroyed trust among whom, exactly? Zuckerberg didn’t say. But President-elect Donald Trump, who keeps fact-checkers busy and hates being corrected by them, welcomed Meta’s changes. So did the wide world of pro-Trump media. “Trump gets results,” Fox’s Laura Ingraham said Tuesday night, touting Meta’s “major shakeup.” As CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan found through his interviews with Trump rallygoers, MAGA loyalists bristled at the existence of fact-checks on Facebook and objected to content moderation that they described as censorship. They trusted Trump over any attempt to fact-check him. But for a wider audience, Meta’s support for outside fact-checking outlets helped make the internet a little bit less polluted by lies and propaganda. Now, some of those outlets may be forced to shut down once Meta’s financial support dries up. “This is a blow to our website and the work that we do,” Jesse Stiller, managing editor of Check Your Fact, told CNN. “We are going to be impacted greatly and our operations will be grounded to a halt. This is not good for discourse and dialogue.” Alan Duke, a former CNN journalist who now runs the fact-checking site Lead Stories, said his firm was blindsided by Meta’s announcement and by Zuckerberg’s accusation about bias. “Meta never questioned Lead Stories about political bias in our six years in the program,” Duke said. “In fact, we would have lost our contract if they suspected it.” Duke said his website will stay in business – it has other sources of funding, including TikTok’s parent company ByteDance – but Meta’s decision affects some of its work in the United States, and “sadly, this will mean some very good journalists will be looking for work elsewhere.” “Without fact checking on Meta, disinfo spreaders will be partying like it’s 2016,” Duke added. That’s the year when made-up stories on social media propelled Facebook and other tech companies to take action. Now, Zuckerberg is essentially reversing those flawed but well-intentioned efforts. The flaws were real – and caused some journalists and activists to assail the entire initiative. Once a post was labeled false or missing context, the content was algorithmically downranked on the platform to avoid spreading misinformation. Angie Drobnic Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network, said the decision “will hurt social media users who are looking for accurate, reliable information to make decisions about their everyday lives and interactions with friends and family.” Holan, the former editor of PolitiFact, challenged Zuckerberg’s claim about bias, saying “that attack line comes from those who feel they should be able to exaggerate and lie without rebuttal or contradiction.” At the risk of referencing 2016 again, it’s a “war on truth.” A 2016 essay with that title, by veteran reporter and author Dan Gillmor, said “U.S. journalists have an obligation to call out presidential candidates when they lie.” Then as now, Trump’s firehose of falsehood was the issue. But Meta’s rollback of its fact-checking ambitions has ramifications far beyond US politics. Science Feedback, another one of Meta’s fact-checking partners, said “the public faces an ever-growing risk of being misled by powerful actors prioritizing their own interests over the well-being of their audience or the public good.” Meta said it will adopt a “community notes” system for fact-checking, modeled on X’s program, which encourages unpaid users with different points of view to agree on corrective notes for misleading content. “While a crowd-sourced model for content verification may work in theory, it cannot magically succeed without relying on expertise, particularly on complex scientific and technical topics like those addressed by Science Feedback,” the group said. Science Feedback recently published an analysis finding that X’s community notes system failed to address “most of the misinformation identified by fact-checkers on the platform” around last year’s European Parliament elections. Duke noted community users were also not bound by ethical guidelines to provide fair and accurate fact checks. “The idea of replacing professional journalists who are bound by the IFCN’s code of ethics with a hodge podge group of ‘community’ volunteers is dangerous,” he said. “A community note participant does not have to follow any rules, does not disclose who is paying them, and is not tested for bias.”"

Streaming and texting on the Moon: Nokia and NASA are taking 4G into space,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html,"Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That’s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year — the exact date has yet to be confirmed — carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon’s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. “The first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,” Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia’s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice — transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network — would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund — especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. “Being able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis — as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,” said Engelund. “Eventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.” It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth’s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ﻿space colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the “framework for the lunar economy.” “A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. “This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.” There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. “Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said."
"The electric car revolution is on track, says IEA",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/cars/electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea/index.html,"Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that “surging demand” for EVs over the next decade was set “to remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.” It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency’s bullish long-term outlook for EVs — based on current government policies — comes just days after the world’s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data “does not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,” he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. In a statement, Birol said: “Rather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.” Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world’s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company’s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China’s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the “pace of the transition to EVs… will hinge on affordability.” In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. “Intensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,” the IEA said. “Growing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,” it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. “China is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,” Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China’s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region’s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. “This shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,” Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

Digital humans: the relatable face of artificial intelligence?,https://edition.cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html,"Scrolling through the Instagram account of DJ and aspiring model Dex you’ll see her wearing new outfits, performing at shows around the world and chatting to her thousands of followers about her hobbies. However, it’s clear that there is something different about Dex; she’s an entirely virtual “digital human,” designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine — a 3D modeling software widely used in video games — combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. “She’s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,” says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. “You can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.” Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she’s a “showpiece” for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can “listen” to people’s questions and converse in real time. “Shellie” can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while “Arif” is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. “What we’ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,” Sims tells CNN. “It becomes natural.” Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI — artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational “digital humans” that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways’ website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market. “When we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?” asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. “In some ways, we think of AI as something that’s helping us or augmenting our work,” she says. “However, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.” Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. “Every scenario that we found, we’re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,” she says. “Digital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,” adds Sims. “We’ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.”"
Top soccer clubs are using an AI-powered app to scout future stars,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html,"A London-based technology company is looking to “democratize” talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. “We’re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts’] time,” said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. “To say [to scouts], ‘Go over to this place today because there’s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard’ — that’s going to be the best use of your time.’” It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract with EPL team Bournemouth in 2021. Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app — which fully launched in September 2023 — according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the “lion’s share” of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for “tier one” sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at $2.7 billion in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. “It’s more about evolution than revolution,” Felton-Thomas explained. “We can’t tell you when that player’s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he’s 2-0 down? What happens when someone’s shouting at him? What happens when he’s just made a massive mistake?” “We’ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you’re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.” While football remains ai.io’s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. “You think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,” Felton-Thomas told CNN."
OpenAI’s wild week. How the Sam Altman story unfolded,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html,"In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week’s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman — the leader of one of the world’s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the most visible figure in the fledgling industry — was fired Friday night by the startup’s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he’s back as the company’s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you’re just catching up, here’s what you missed from a week so incredible you’d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI’s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI’s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman’s ouster just minutes before the board’s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he “loved working with such talented people” and that he would have “more to say about what’s next later.” Brockman promptly quit. “Please don’t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,” Brockman said in a Friday post on X. “Greater things coming soon.” A key factor in the CEO’s firing was tension between Altman, who favored developing AI more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI’s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. By Sunday afternoon, Altman was back at OpenAI’s headquarters — this time with a guest badge — to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman’s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon’s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI’s chief technology officer. In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as “a once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman’s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company’s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, “we have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i’m so excited. one team, one mission.” The drama was far from over. The Verge reported Monday afternoon that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was “open to both options” when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. “Look, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,” Nadella said. “We chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.” Altman was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI’s CEO, the company said on X. “We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo. “We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft. It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.” Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. “We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”"
Sam Altman returns to OpenAI in a bizarre reversal of fortunes,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html,"Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. “We have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,” the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo. “We are collaborating to figure out the details,” it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is “looking forward” to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm’s “strong partnership” with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker’s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman’s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently “candid” with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman’s ouster was the presence of tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously, according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher, who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company’s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company’s board didn’t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It’s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman’s return. Posting on X, Shear wrote: “I am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work … I’m glad to have been a part of the solution.” Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. “We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.” Altman’s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he has pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. “Is [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?” he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. “Or is it gonna be more like the atom bomb — huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?” But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI’s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft’s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly been in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. — CNN’s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting."
Opinion: The drama around Sam Altman is an urgent warning,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html,"The biggest tech news this week is the ouster of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to resign. Altman has already moved on to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its third CEO in as many days. It’s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company’s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions – governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies – reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence “to benefit humanity as a whole.” But that sensibility hasn’t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it – but they also won’t tell reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic – a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors – is partly to blame for Altman’s firing. The OpenAI board, according to CNN’s David Goldman, worried that “the company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.” At particular issue seemed to be Altman’s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company’s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he’ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy – without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to suggest the design to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers acutely understand just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper’s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and “gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force” in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans, according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don’t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, “no gas mask is helping anyone.” (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI’s risks – at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils – the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of “it may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier” but in the sense of “it could break down human societies and kill us all.” Given the life-altering potential of AI – that even if it doesn’t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed – we all have a stake in how it’s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be largely men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve – and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential – except likely more difficult to regulate and control. “Regulation” does not begin to scratch the surface of what’s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity – our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?"
Microsoft stock hits all-time high after hiring former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/20/investing/microsoft-stock-record-high-altman-openai/index.html,"Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg. Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm’s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman’s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman’s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the “Magnificent Seven” that have powered the lion’s share of the market’s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street’s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech. Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, reiterated his $425 price target for Microsoft’s stock following Altman’s and Brockman’s hires. “We view Microsoft now even in a stronger position from an AI perspective with Altman and Brockman” at the company, Ives wrote in a note on Monday. Other members of the “Magnificent Seven” saw a boost on Monday. Nvidia shares gained 2.3% to end the trading session at $504.20 ahead of its earnings due on Tuesday, notching a record-high close for the chipmaker."

The next leg of the new moon race is about to kick off — and it could be the most exciting yet,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/science/lunar-landers-moon-missions-2025/index.html,"The past few years have marked the advent of a new lunar space race, with a fleet of robotic spacecraft from various countries trying — and mostly failing — to reach the moon and carry out their intended missions. But 2025 may offer a second chance for the companies and countries behind those missions that crashed and burned, as well as introduce some new players to the field. January will kick off with the launch of two lunar landers in one fell swoop: A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will carry spacecraft developed by Cedar Park, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and Tokyo-based Ispace. Firefly is making its first attempt to put a vehicle on the moon, but this mission marks a second try for Ispace, after its first lander crashed and blasted a divot in the lunar surface in 2023. And those two landers are only a couple of the uncrewed missions looking to reach the lunar surface — or seek redemption — in the coming months. This year promises to be among the most tantalizing yet in humanity’s renewed push to explore the moon, with the United States and its allies as well as China scrambling to send robots to the lunar surface. Many of these machine-driven missions are designed to pave the way for astronauts to return to the lunar surface, as NASA plans to do as soon as 2027. Here’s a glance at some of the moon shots on the horizon. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket slated to launch landers for both Firefly and Ispace is set to liftoff as soon as 1:11 a.m. ET Wednesday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. If all goes according to plan, Firefly’s lander, called Blue Ghost, will spend about 45 days making a careful approach to its lunar destination around Mons Latreille, an ancient volcanic feature in a more than 300-mile-wide (483-kilometer) basin called Mare Crisium, or the “Sea of Crises,” on the moon’s near side. “Mare Crisium was created by early volcanic eruptions and flooded with basaltic lava more than 3 billion years ago,” according to Firefly. “This unique landing site will allow our payload partners to gather critical data about the Moon’s regolith (rock and dust rubble), geophysical characteristics, and the interaction of solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field.” On board Blue Ghost will be a group of science experiments and technology demonstrations, including ones that will test a “Lunar PlanetVac” to collect and sort soil samples on the moon, satellite navigation, radiation-adapated computers, and self-cleaning glass that can wipe away lunar dust, according to Firefly. For its inaugural mission, Blue Ghost is expected to operate on the moon for about 14 days before its landing zone is plunged into the frigid temperatures of lunar nighttime. Firefly is among the participants in NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program in which the space agency partners with private companies to deliver payloads to the moon. Others contractors include Houston-based Intuitive Machines and Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology. The goal of the CLPS program is to give NASA a pool of commercial robotic landers that can ferry cargo to the lunar surface as the space agency works on separate plans to get its astronauts to the moon later this decade. “It’s a good time for the lunar economy,” Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CNN in December, adding that he’s “100% confident in our team’s ability” to land the company’s Blue Ghost vehicle successfully. Success, of course, is not guaranteed. Ispace, the Japan-based company, understands that all too well: The company’s first attempt to put one of its Hakuto-R landers on the moon ended in a dramatic failure in April 2023 because of navigation issues. Now, an upgraded Hakuto-R spacecraft, named Resilience, will offer Ispace a second chance. The spacecraft will take a much slower path to the moon than Blue Ghost after the landers are deployed from their Falcon 9 rocket. Resilience is aiming to land on the moon roughly four to five months after liftoff, according to Jumpei Nozaki, the Ispace’s chief financial officer. On this mission, the Resillience lander will carry a tiny rover as well as tech instruments with various goals, including testing algae-based food production and monitoring deep-space radiation. Ispace is targeting an area of the moon called Mare Frigoris — or the “Sea of Cold,” which lies in the far northern reaches of the moon’s near side — for its landing location. Houston-based Intuitive Machines made history in February 2024 by putting a US-made lunar lander on the moon for the first time in more than five decades. The triumphant touchdown of the company’s Nova-C lunar lander, called Odysseus, spurred jubilant cheers during the company’s webcast. But the landing wasn’t perfect: Odysseus tipped over on its side because of a navigation issue, leaving the vehicle to run with limited power and capabilities. But Intuitive Machines will soon get another shot at perfection with a new Nova-C lander, called Athena, set to make its way moonward this year. The mission, slated to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, could kick off as soon as late February, the company confirmed Monday. It will aim to land near the moon’s south pole — a region considered crucial to the current moon race because it’s believed to be home to stores of water ice. Water found there could be used to provide astronauts with drinking water or even converted to rocket fuel. Notably, on board Athena will be PRIME-1, or the Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment 1, a NASA-developed tech demo designed to search and drill for water ice. Also sharing a ride with Athena will be NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer, a satellite designed to orbit the moon and use remote sensing to detect water. If both of those NASA payloads succeed, it will be a welcome win for the space agency, which lost at least four research satellites during its November 2022 Artemis I mission. The primary goal of that flight — to send an unoccupied crew capsule on a test flight around the moon — went smoothly. But a group of small NASA satellites deployed alongside the spacecraft, including two meant to hunt for lunar water, failed to hit their marks. Blue Origin, the space company Jeff Bezos founded in 2000, may also debut a prototype of its lunar lander. The spacecraft, called Blue Moon, is one of two vehicles NASA has picked to potentially ferry astronauts from lunar orbit down to the surface of the moon. Blue Origin’s contract for that task is worth $3.4 billion. (The other vehicle NASA selected is SpaceX’s Starship, which will aim to carry out the first landing in 2027.) A Blue Moon vehicle capable of carrying humans is likely at least a few years away from its debut, but Blue Origin plans to launch a “pathfinder” lander for cargo missions to the moon as soon as this year. It’s not clear exactly when, however, or if that timeline will stick. The mission will send a robotic lander to test Blue Moon’s design and engine capabilities, aiming to ensure a smooth ride for future missions with valuable science payloads or crew on board. NASA will also put one science instrument on board called Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume Surface Studies, or SCALPSS, which is a set of cameras designed to monitor how moon dust reacts to the engines of landers as they head in for touchdown. Blue Origin’s pathfinder spacecraft is slated to launch atop one of the company’s New Glenn rockets, which was set to make its debut flight Monday morning. But Blue Origin aborted the inaugural launch attempt as engineers worked to troubleshoot an undisclosed issue with the rocket. More moon missions are on the docket for later this year, though the complexity of such endeavors routinely leads to delays. That said, Intuitive Machines could launch its third robotic lunar mission, called IM-3, as soon as October. Astrobotic Technology may also get a chance to bounce back from a disappointing first go at a moon landing in 2024. Its Peregrine lander began leaking fuel after reaching space last January, forcing the vehicle to swing back toward Earth and abandon its lunar ambitions. The company has a new, larger vehicle — called Griffin — in the works for a launch as soon as this year. However, Astrobotic has already hit several complications with Griffin, including NASA’s cancellation of a rover meant to fly on board the lunar lander. That rover, called the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, remains in limbo. But Astrobotic has said it may outfit Griffin with some of the company’s own technology, such as infrastructure for its planned lunar power business called LunaGrid. Finally, according to a timeline laid out in early 2024, SpaceX may attempt to send an uncrewed Starship spacecraft — the most powerful launch vehicle ever made — to the moon. It’s not clear if that mission will actually happen in 2025. When reached for comment, a NASA spokesperson confirmed in an emailed statement that conducting an uncrewed test mission to the moon is part of the space agency’s development requirements for SpaceX’s Starship — but the statement did not say whether the rocket may be ready for such a demo this year. “NASA continues to work closely with SpaceX on progress toward milestones, including a design review, individual subsystem development and testing, and SpaceX’s integrated flight test campaign,” the space agency said. “Please refer to SpaceX for more information on their development progress.” SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment nor does the company typically respond to routine inquiries from reporters. Officials at NASA, however, have more recently indicated that SpaceX at least plans to ramp up Starship development this year, completing missions that will show how the spacecraft can be refueled once in orbit. (Starship is expected to need its propellant topped off multiple times as it sits in Earth orbit before it can complete a moon mission.) Whether all these missions squeeze onto the 2025 calendar remains to be seen. What’s certain, however, is that NASA, the commercial space sector, and nations around the globe are fomenting their desires to renew lunar exploration. NASA, for example, wants more than just to return American astronauts to the lunar surface: The federal agency is seeking to establish a permanent settlement there, angling to compete with the ambitions of China, which is aiming to put boots on the moon by 2030. The pursuits by the US and China are in part nationalistic and political. But the objectives are also scientific. “From a scientific perspective, if we think about it, the moon is a repository of information of what’s been happening to both the moon and Earth over time,” said Dr. Bethany Ehlmann, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology and the principal investigator for NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer orbiter. “So a big question is, where did this water on the moon come from? Is it ancient? And then, what does that tell us about how the Earth got water?”"
Blue Origin stands down from New Glenn launch attempt — again,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/science/new-glenn-blue-origin-rocket-launch-attempt/index.html,"Blue Origin, the rocket company founded by Jeff Bezos in 2000, has called off a second attempt to launch its 30-story New Glenn rocket. The vehicle had been slated to get off the ground early Monday, but the company waved off that plan so engineers could work to address a technical issue with the vehicle. By Monday evening, after roughly 16 hours with no update and no word on what exactly that problem was — Blue Origin took to social media to declare it could make a second attempt during a three-hour launch window that opens at 1 a.m. ET Tuesday. Just a couple of hours later, however, Blue Origin revealed it would not try for the overnight liftoff after all. “We’re moving our NG-1 launch to no earlier than Thursday, January 16,” the company said in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. That day, Blue Origin will have the same three-hour, early-morning launch window from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. ET. The company did not immediately say why it reversed course on plans to attempt a New Glenn launch Tuesday morning. But Blue Origin had cautioned earlier that unfavorable weather conditions at the takeoff site may lead to another scrub. “Tonight’s poor weather forecast at LC-36 could result in missing this window,” the company said in a Monday evening post. In the dispatch, Blue Origin also disclosed more detail on the problem engineers had sought to fix during the last attempt. “This morning’s scrub was due to ice forming in a purge line on an auxiliary power unit that powers some of our hydraulic systems,” the company said. A “purge line” is a pipe or tube that can be used to flush out any unwanted gases or debris from a rocket system. That detail was more than Blue Origin offered during its webcast of Monday’s launch attempt. At the time, the company revealed only that engineers were grappling with “anomalies,” which is aerospace parlance for issues with the rocket that must be fixed before giving the final green light for takeoff. “We are standing down from today’s launch attempt to troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue” said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin’s vice president of in-space systems. At one point Monday morning, the countdown clock crept down to show less than 10 minutes before liftoff, but Blue Origin periodically added more time as engineers worked to troubleshoot outstanding issues. Ultimately, the problems were not resolved with ample time before the launch window was set to close at 4 a.m. ET. A smooth inaugural liftoff for New Glenn could be crucial, as the company is hoping to gather copious data from this flight and pave the way for the rocket to quickly make an impact on the global launch industry. New Glenn is the first rocket developed by Blue Origin that aims to be capable of sending satellites to orbit — a feat that will be necessary for any company hoping to challenge SpaceX’s long-held dominance in the launch market. Blue Origin waved off the New Glenn launch heading into a busy week for spaceflight. Notably, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying two lunar landers is set to take off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center — which lies adjacent to Cape Canaveral — as soon as Wednesday at 1:11 a.m. ET. SpaceX is also due to kick off the seventh test flight of its gargantuan Starship rocket on Wednesday."
Moon rover-inspired robot could be a game-changer for Japan’s aging farmers,https://edition.cnn.com/science/japan-robot-farming-kisui-adam-spc/index.html,"Japan’s population is the oldest in the world, with a third aged over 65, and one in 10 aged over 80, due to a combination of low fertility rates and high life expectancy. This has a direct effect on its working-age population — the share of 15 to 64 year-olds — which is projected to shrink by 30 million people between 2020 and 2070. Agriculture is particularly hit by the problem: according to Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the number of people mainly employed in farming halved between 2000 and 2023, and those aged under 60 only make up about 20% of the total. To combat this shortage, along with a more relaxed stance on immigration and fertility policies, the country is increasingly looking at robotics to supplement the workforce. Tamir Blum founded Kisui Tech while still a student, in 2021 — a company that is using technology from space exploration to build an AI-assisted farming robot. “In the past 20 years or so, 50% of the farmers have retired, meaning that there’s more and more burden on fewer and fewer farmers to keep producing a stable food supply,” he says. The semi-autonomous robot is called Adam and is able to carry picked produce across difficult terrain as well as cut grass and spray fields with pesticides. Blum, an Israeli-American who first visited Japan in 2015, returned to the country in 2018 for a PhD during which he researched lunar rovers and their ability to navigate bumpy and uneven terrain. “During that PhD program, I traveled a lot around the Japanese countryside,” he says, “You can tell how much difficulty (it) is having with the labor shortage. You see many abandoned houses … The farmers are clearly getting older … I realized how difficult it was, and also the great potential for this type of off-road robotics technology to be applied, especially for outdoor orchards, which are also very, very bumpy — similar to what I was researching for space robotics.” Kisui Tech is working with the Agriculture Department at Chiba University, near Tokyo, in developing two models of Adam — a full-size and a mini version — and testing them in real-life scenarios on farms around Japan. The larger Adam is 70 centimeters high and 188 centimeters in length, and is aimed primarily at apple and pear farmers, with a large truckbed to carry produce or fertilizer. The smaller Adam, about one third of the size, is targeting grape and persimmon farms, which are planted in narrower rows. Alongside the robots, Kisui is also developing an online platform called Newton, which gives farmers real-time insights into crops, diseases, and farm management. Adam is expected to retail for around $20,000 on international markets. “I’ve been really amazed by the reaction of the farmers,” says Blum, “because in Japan, I think most people would have a stereotype that farmers are very traditional: they don’t like technology, they’re not willing to try new things. However … they’ve been very receptive, very willing to give advice, very willing to try Adam.” Adam is approaching commercial release and has been radically transformed from early versions based on feedback from the farmers. For example, a touchscreen was replaced by a panel with physical buttons, because farmers often wear gloves, which don’t work well with touchscreens. Kisui recently completed its first paid proof of concept to automate patrol and data collection at a solar plant for a Japanese power company. Blum says it has also received requests from the construction industry, looking to use the robot for patrols, security and transporting heavy goods. “We see Adam as a tool, not just for farming, but basically all outdoor work,” says Blum."
See the full wolf moon overtake Mars in the night sky and glimpse a planetary parade,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/science/full-moon-mars-bright-planets/index.html,"Keep an eye on the sky Monday evening to see the wolf moon, the first full moon of the year. And some sky-gazers will be able to glimpse a cosmic magic trick when the moon appears to pass in front of Mars. The full moon will be at peak illumination at 5:27 p.m. ET Monday but will appear full into Wednesday morning, according to NASA. Viewers in most of the continental United States, eastern Canada, and parts of Africa and Mexico can look for a celestial triangle in the sky when evening twilight ends at 6:11 p.m. ET. Mars will appear just to the lower left of the moon, while the bright star Pollux will be a few degrees to the upper left of the moon, according to NASA. Times for the moon passing in front of Mars will vary, so be sure to check your favorite sky-watching app. For those on the US East Coast, Mars will disappear behind the bottom of the moon around 9:16 p.m. ET and reappear behind the upper right of the moon at 10:31 p.m. ET. January’s full moon is commonly called the wolf moon because wolves are active this time of year and can be heard howling on cold winter nights, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. The origin of the name stems from the Sioux language, which describes this moon as “wolves run together.” But this wintry full moon also goes by other monikers. It’s known as the cold moon to the Cherokee people, the hard moon to the Lakota and the whirling wind moon to the Passamaquoddy tribe. European names also include the ice moon, the old moon or the moon after Yule, originally a three to 12-day festival that occurred in pre-Christian Europe near the winter solstice, according to NASA. January’s full moon also ties in with the beginning of the Hindu pilgrimage and 44-day festival of Prayag Kumbh Mela, held every 12 years in the Indian city of Prayagraj. The full moon will be visible around the world, weather permitting. If you’re in the Northern Hemisphere, bundle up to stay warm and enjoy the view. After Mars does its disappearing trick behind the moon, look for the red planet to appear at its closest and brightest on Wednesday. During January, Mars is at opposition, meaning it’s directly opposite the sun from the vantage point of Earth. As the two planets travel along their orbital paths, Earth will be between Mars and the sun. The red planet will shine brightly each evening, according to NASA. Look for it in the east each night, as well as in the northwest at dawn. Mars isn’t the only planet to keep an eye out for this month. Sky-gazers can look forward to catching glimpses of four bright planets at the same time in the night sky. Venus and Saturn will appear in the southwest, Jupiter will gleam overhead, and Mars will appear to rise in the east. The planets will appear to rotate westward around the bright star Polaris and will be visible each night beginning early in the evening. Venus and Saturn will slowly appear to come close together in the night sky during what’s called the Venus and Saturn conjunction, although they are hundreds of millions of miles apart. The two planets will appear the nearest to one another on Friday and Saturday because of the positions of their orbits around the sun. Uranus and Neptune will be visible, too, albeit with the aid of binoculars or telescopes, according to EarthSky. While some may rush to call this parade a special alignment of the planets, there’s nothing unusual about it — although seeing four or five bright planets in the night sky at once is less common. Planets always appear along a line in the sky because they all orbit the sun in a mostly flat plane called the ecliptic. “Planets in our solar system, when they are visible, are always in a line because they follow the path of the sun — the ecliptic — across our sky. But they aren’t in a line stretching out, one behind another, from the sun, into 3-dimensional space,” according to EarthSky. So, enjoy the spectacle as bright planets appear to march across the night sky this month, and if you want to glimpse even more, set up a telescope and potentially spot moons around some of these neighboring worlds. Check out the following events occurring in our skies to add to your calendar. February 12: Snow moon March 14: Worm moon April 12: Pink moon May 12: Flower moon June 11: Strawberry moon July 10: Buck moon August 9: Sturgeon moon September 7: Corn moon October 6: Harvest moon November 5: Beaver moon December 4: Cold moon In 2025, there will be two partial solar eclipses. A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, but none of the celestial bodies is perfectly aligned, according to NASA.Unlike during a total solar eclipse, the moon only blocks part of the sun’s face, creating a crescent shape in which it appears the moon is taking a “bite” out of the sun. The first partial solar eclipse will happen on March 29, and it will be visible across parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and North and South America. The second partial solar eclipse will fall on September 21 and be visible over parts of Australia and Antarctica as well as some islands in the Pacific Ocean. There will also be two total lunar eclipses that occur during the March and September full moon events. A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when Earth is between the sun and moon and the three celestial objects line up in a row so that the moon passes into our planet’s shadow. When the moon is within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra, it takes on a reddish hue, which has led to the nickname “blood moon” for a lunar eclipse, according to NASA. That shadow isn’t perfect, so faint sunbeams sneak around the shadow’s edges on all sides in the colors of a sunset, bathing the moon in brilliant, warm hues. The first total lunar eclipse will be visible between March 13-14 and cross over Western Europe, parts of Asia, parts of Australia, western Africa, North and South America, and Antarctica. The second total lunar eclipse will occur on September 7-8 and be visible from Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of eastern South America, Alaska and Antarctica. Check Time and Date’s website to see when each of these eclipses will appear and the locations that will be able to view them. Here are peak dates for upcoming annual meteor showers, according to the American Meteor Society.

A powerful potential challenger to SpaceX’s rocket dominance is poised to launch,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/science/new-glenn-launch-blue-origin/index.html,"Nearly a quarter century after Jeff Bezos founded Blue Origin, the rocket company is poised for its most defining moment to date: sending a vehicle to orbit for the first time. Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket is set to make its inaugural launch attempt as soon as 1 a.m. ET Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. A live stream of the mission is slated to kick off about an hour before liftoff on the social media platform X, Blue Origin’s YouTube channel, and its website, the company said via email. The new target launch time was announced after Blue Origin chose to wave off plans to get New Glenn off the ground in the early hours of Sunday morning. The company said weather conditions at sea, where the company hopes to recover part of the rocket after launch, prompted the 24-hour delay. The roughly 320-foot (98-meter) New Glenn is not only the first Blue Origin rocket designed to be capable of hauling satellites to space, it’s also among the most powerful in the world. Categorized as a heavy-lift launch vehicle, it packs more than twice the power that SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket gives off during takeoff. The uncrewed New Glenn mission will carry Blue Origin-made demonstration technology, called the Blue Ring Pathfinder, to orbit. If successful, New Glenn’s launch debut could position Blue Origin to better compete with Elon Musk’s SpaceX — which has long dominated the commercial launch sector. If all goes according to plan, the New Glenn rocket will fire up seven BE-4 engines at the base of its first-stage rocket booster, which is the largest part of the vehicle that gives the first burst of power at liftoff. A few minutes into flight, after burning through most of its fuel, the booster will detach from the upper portion of the rocket, which includes the vehicle’s nose cone, or payload fairing, that’s designed to shield cargo during liftoff. The booster will then use fins and strakes — or winglike attachments that flare out from its top and base, respectively — to help guide itself toward its landing target, a seafaring recovery platform named Jacklyn after Bezos’ mother. Just before touching down on the platform, the booster will reignite some of its engines and deploy six massive legs to stand on. The landing maneuver, designed to allow Blue Origin to refurbish and reuse rocket boosters— much like SpaceX does with its Falcon rockets — is an attempt to save money and drive down the cost of launches. Meanwhile, the upper portion of New Glenn, carrying the Blue Ring Pathfinder experiment, will continue toward the cosmos. Two engines, optimized to function in the vacuum of space, should fire up and propel the vehicle to speeds necessary to enter orbit — typically around 17,500 miles per hour, or nearly 23 times the speed of sound. For this flight, Blue Origin said it will not deploy a satellite into orbit. Rather, the Blue Ring Pathfinder payload is expected to remain attached to the rocket’s upper stage for the duration of the six-hour mission. Success is not guaranteed. At any point during the flight, New Glenn could encounter a mission-ending failure. So far, the company has only ignited all seven BE-4 engines at the base of this rocket for 24 seconds during a ground test in late December. For this flight, the engines must fire for at least several times that duration as New Glenn attempts to defy Earth’s gravitational pull. If something goes wrong, and New Glenn begins to fly off its intended course, the company may be forced to implement a self-destruct feature — blowing the rocket to smithereens so it will not pose a threat to people or property. Blue Origin could also see success on its primary mission: safely getting the rocket’s second stage and Blue Ring Pathfinder technology into its intended orbit. But even if that objective goes to plan, the company may still fail to land its New Glenn rocket booster on the Jacklyn platform after launch. Failure to safely land the rocket booster, however, would not make the mission unsuccessful: Recovering rocket parts for reuse is a feat aimed solely at saving Blue Origin money. Most rocket builders, apart from SpaceX, discard that portion of the rocket after launch anyway. If and when New Glenn proves it can get the job done, the vehicle is likely to make a big splash in the launch market, said Caleb Henry, the director of research at Quilty Space, which provides data and analysis about the space sector. “They are postured so that they can come in and try to fill this role of being the next great, reliable launch provider for the industry,” Henry said. The New Glenn is a heavy-lift vehicle, Henry noted, and vehicles of its size and power have “grown in importance over the years.” Roughly a decade ago, rocket companies anticipated that small, lightweight rockets would become the next launch phenomenon because they would be capable of rapidly launching satellites intended to flesh out a string of megaconstellations — or networks of small satellites — in low-Earth orbit. “But two things happened,” Henry said. “First is that none of the constellation (operators) went to small rockets. They all went to the medium- or heavy-lift because getting more up in a single mission is faster and more economical than doing this one or two satellites at a time. And then the second is those satellites themselves got bigger.”"
Ice core may hold answers to mysteries of Earth’s past,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/science/antarctica-ice-core-science-newsletter-wt/index.html,"One of the best ways to assemble the puzzle pieces of Earth’s past is hiding deep beneath its white polar sheets: ice cores. These frozen time capsules preserve air bubbles from thousands of years ago, painting a picture of climate and environmental conditions at the time to reveal how much our planet has changed. Ice cores can show how temperatures have fluctuated in the distant past and preview how quickly sea levels could rise in the future if warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions isn’t curbed. The deeper the cores go, the more history they contain — and the icy layers could also solve some of the biggest questions about mysterious eras in Earth’s 4.5 billion-year history. A research team has collected what may be among the oldest ice samples on Earth. The team, with members from 12 European scientific institutions, drilled and retrieved a 9,186-foot-long (2,800-meter) ice core from the Antarctic ice sheet. The sample extended so deep that scientists reached the bedrock beneath it. The ice core spans at least 1.2 million years of Earth’s climate history. Air bubbles and particles trapped inside the ice could also reveal why the planet’s ice ages suddenly became longer and more intense about 1 million years ago, which may have caused ancient human populations to plummet. Tahlequah, a mother orca, became known around the world in 2018 for the heartbreaking act of carrying her dead calf for more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) over 17 days. Now, she appears to be grieving a second tragic loss. Her newest calf was spotted on December 20 in Washington state’s Puget Sound, but by New Year’s Eve, scientists confirmed the baby orca had died. As before, Tahlequah began carrying her lost calf. The orca’s act of mourning, in which she nudges the deceased calf’s 300-pound (136-kilogram) body to prevent it from floating away, has raised concern among researchers — not only for the emotional and physical toll it could take but also its impact on Tahlequah as a member of a highly vulnerable killer whale population. The long-delayed maiden flight of a rocket that could challenge SpaceX’s dominance in the commercial space industry is set to blast off from a Florida launchpad as soon as early Sunday morning. The uncrewed vehicle, named New Glenn after storied NASA astronaut John Glenn, will mark the first attempt by Jeff Bezos’ company Blue Origin to send a rocket into orbit. The company’s most powerful rocket could one day be used to ferry Amazon internet satellites to space or assist in constructing a space station Blue Origin is developing with its partners. When New Glenn launches, Blue Origin will attempt to guide its first-stage rocket booster back for a safe landing. But remember: Smooth flights are never guaranteed for inaugural missions. Pluto is a bit of an outlier in our solar system because the dwarf planet has an unusually large moon. Astronomers have tried to solve the riddle of why Pluto shares an orbit with a satellite about half its size, and how the moon came to be in the first place. New research suggests that the two icy, rocky bodies came together about 4 billion years ago in a newly discovered type of collision called a “kiss and capture.” Rather than melting together or ricocheting, Pluto and Charon essentially merged in a cosmic snowman-like shape before gradually separating again into the orbit they share now. Scientists think the odd collision may be responsible for the subsurface ocean suspected to exist beneath Pluto’s icy crust. While extracting limestone from Dewars Farm Quarry in Oxfordshire, England, quarry worker Gary Johnson sensed “unusual bumps” on the ground. Detecting the bumps led to the unearthing of a “dinosaur highway,” a pathway of nearly 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years. The astonishing find is the largest known dinosaur track site in the United Kingdom. Some of the trackways belonged to lumbering long-necked dinosaurs such as Cetiosaurus and massive three-toed predators such as Megalosaurus, revealing insights about their behaviors as well as the speed at which the creatures moved. “It’s like a snapshot into the day of the (dinosaurs’) life, and what they were doing,” said Kirsty Edgar, a professor of micropaleontology at England’s University of Birmingham. Take a closer look: — Sixteenth-century explorer Antonio Pigafetta described golden lion tamarins, found in eastern Brazil, as “beautiful, simian-like cats similar to small lions.” Once on the brink of extinction, the endangered small monkeys are making a comeback, thanks to conservation efforts. — Retrieving crucial samples from Mars is a complex endeavor. By 2026, NASA will decide between two key proposals to return a cache that could help determine whether life ever existed beyond Earth. — Water hyacinth, which can choke fish and trap boats, is the world’s most widespread invasive species. Now, a Kenyan company is turning the problematic plant into a bioplastic that could help with reforestation efforts."
"On a long-dormant pad in Florida, a rocket that could challenge SpaceX’s dominance is poised to launch",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/04/science/bezos-blue-origin-musk-spacex/index.html,"On a Florida launchpad that has been dormant for almost two decades, a new, roughly 320-foot (98-meter) rocket — developed by Jeff Bezos’ company Blue Origin — is poised for its maiden flight. The uncrewed launch vehicle, called New Glenn, will mark Blue Origin’s first attempt to send a rocket to orbit, a feat necessary if the company hopes to chip away at SpaceX’s long-held dominance in the industry. New Glenn is set to lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station as early as Sunday during a three-hour launch window that opens at 1 a.m. ET. A livestream of the mission is slated to kick off about an hour before liftoff on YouTube and Blue Origin’s website, the company said via email. The rocket, which stands about as tall as a 30-story building, consists of several parts: The first-stage rocket booster gives the initial thrust at liftoff. Atop the booster is an upper rocket stage that includes a cargo bay protected by a nose cone that will house experimental technology for this mission. And, in an attempt to replicate the success that SpaceX has found reusing rocket boosters over the past decade, Blue Origin will also aim to guide New Glenn’s first-stage rocket booster back to a safe landing on a seafaring platform — named Jacklyn for Bezos’ mother — minutes after takeoff. Like SpaceX, Blue Origin will seek to recover, refurbish and reuse first-stage rocket boosters to drive down costs. For this inaugural mission, a smooth flight is not guaranteed. But the eventual success of New Glenn, named after storied NASA astronaut John Glenn, is instrumental to some of Blue Origin’s most ambitious goals. The rocket could one day power national security launches, haul Amazon internet satellites to space and even help in the construction of a space station that Blue Origin is developing with commercial partners. Blue Origin formally announced the development of New Glenn — which aims to outpower SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets and haul spacecraft up to 45 metric tons (99,200 pounds) to orbit — in 2016. The vehicle is long overdue, as the company previously targeted 2020 for its first launch. Delays, however, are common in the aerospace industry. And the debut flight of a new vehicle is almost always significantly behind schedule. Rocket companies also typically take a conservative approach to the first liftoff, launching dummy payloads such as hunks of metal or, as was the case with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy debut in 2018, an old cherry red sports car. Blue Origin has also branded itself as a company that aims to take a slow, diligent approach to rocket development that doesn’t “cut any corners,” according to Bezos, who founded Blue Origin and funds the company. The company’s mascot is a tortoise, paying homage to “The Tortoise and the Hare” fable that made the “slow and steady wins the race” mantra a childhood staple. “We believe slow is smooth and smooth is fast,” Bezos said in 2016. Those comments could be seen as an attempt to position Blue Origin as the anti-SpaceX, which is known to embrace speed and trial-and-error over slow, meticulous development processes. But SpaceX has certainly won the race to orbit. The company’s first orbital rocket, the Falcon 1, made a successful launch in September 2008. The company has deployed hundreds of missions to orbit since then. And while SpaceX routinely destroys rockets during test flights as it begins developing a new rocket, the company has a solid track record for operational missions. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, for example, has experienced two in-flight failures and one launchpad explosion but no catastrophic events during human missions. So far, Blue Origin has been known mostly for its space tourism efforts, launching paying customers and celebrities on New Shepard — a much smaller, suborbital rocket that is not powerful enough to send satellites to space. Of the more than 20 flights New Shepard has conducted so far, the vehicle has experienced one failure during an uncrewed science mission. While SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk and Bezos have been known to spar and bluster publicly about their rocket companies, Musk’s input on New Glenn’s debut so far has been positive: “Godspeed!” he posted on his social media platform X on December 27. In some ways, New Glenn has already made its mark on the launch industry. Blue Origin has for years pitched the rocket to compete with both SpaceX and United Launch Alliance — a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin that buys engines from Blue Origin — for lucrative military launch contracts. The US Space Force selected Blue Origin, ULA and SpaceX in June to compete for $5.6 billion worth of Pentagon contracts for national security missions slated to launch over the next four years. Blue Origin also has deals with several commercial companies to launch satellites. The contracts include plans to help deploy Amazon’s Kuiper internet satellites and a recently inked deal with AST SpaceMobile  to help launch the Midland, Texas-based company’s space-based cellular broadband network. New Glenn could also be instrumental in building Blue Origin’s planned space station, called Orbital Reef. Blue Origin and it commercial partners, including Sierra Space and Boeing, among others, hope the station will one day provide a new destination for astronauts as the International Space Station is phased out of service. New Glenn packs significant power. Dubbed a “heavy-lift” vehicle, its capabilities lie between SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and the more powerful Falcon Heavy launch vehicle. SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9, for example, can haul up to 22.8 metric tons (50,265 pounds) to space. While New Glenn is capable of carrying about double that mass, it may also be roughly the same price as a Falcon 9: reportedly around $60 million to $70 million per launch. “I think in order to compete with Falcon 9, you have to go head-to-head or better on price,” said Caleb Henry, the director of research at Quilty Space, which provides data and analysis about the space sector. The question, however, is whether Blue Origin will be able to sustain a competitive price point, Henry added. Still, one feature that makes New Glenn stand out is its large payload fairing, or nose cone. The component protects the cargo bay and is a whopping 23 feet (7 meters) wide — nearly 6 feet (2 meters) larger than that of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy. Henry said Blue Origin likely opted to outfit New Glenn with such a large fairing in order to help fulfill Bezos’ vision of the future. The tech billionaire has long described a desire to one day move manufacturing and other polluting, “heavy” industries off Earth, leaving our home planet as a sort of national park for humans to visit and enjoy. And to do that, he would need rockets that can carry huge objects. Though New Glenn outpowers the Falcon 9, SpaceX is in the process of developing the groundbreaking flagship of its rocket arsenal. Like Bezos, SpaceX’s Musk has his own concept of our future in space, with humans living and working on other planets, particularly Mars. To help realize that vision, SpaceX is developing Starship, the largest and most powerful launch vehicle ever constructed. The nearly 400-foot-tall (121-meter) rocket dwarfs New Glenn in every sense: Musk has said he hopes Starship will haul up to 300 tons to orbit. SpaceX has billed Starship as a rocket that could make all others obsolete because it aims to drastically reduce the price per kilogram of getting cargo (or people) to space. Whether that will actually happen remains to be seen, Henry noted. “But I think that if SpaceX continues to lower the cost of access to space, they’ll always be the No. 1 competitor,” Henry said. Blue Origin had planned to launch a pair of Mars-bound satellites on behalf of NASA for the first flight of New Glenn. But delays with the rocket’s development prompted the space agency to change course, moving that flight to this spring at the earliest. So for this inaugural flight, Blue Origin opted to instead fly a “demonstrator” that will test technology needed for the company’s proposed Blue Ring spacecraft — which will aim to serve as a sort of in-space rideshare vehicle, dragging satellites deeper into space when needed. The demonstrator on this New Glenn flight will remain aboard the rocket for the entire six-hour flight, Blue Origin said, and it will validate “communications capabilities from orbit to ground” as well as “test its in-space telemetry, tracking and command hardware, and ground-based radiometric tracking.” The Blue Ring Pathfinder demonstrator is part of a deal Blue Origin inked with the US Department of Defense’s Defense Innovation Unit. Similar to SpaceX, Blue Origin is aiming to recover and refly its first-stage rocket boosters in a bid to make launches less expensive. “Reusability is integral to radically reducing cost-per-launch,” the company said in a recent news release, using the same oft-repeated sentiment that SpaceX has touted since it began landing rocket boosters in 2015. Bezos, however, has acknowledged the importance of reusing rocket parts since he founded the company in 2000 — two years before Musk established SpaceX. And the company has already developed its suborbital New Shepard tourism rocket to be reusable. “It’s not a copy cat game,” Henry said. “Blue Origin has been pursuing reusable vehicles since before reusable vehicles were cool. Now it’s much more of a mainstream idea (because of SpaceX). The difference is that it’s taken Blue Origin so much longer to get to orbit.” If successful, returning the New Glenn rocket booster for a safe landing will be a stunning feat. After expending most of its fuel to propel the rocket’s upper stage to space, the first-stage booster will need to make a clean separation. The booster must then maneuver with pinpoint guidance and reignite its engines with precision timing to avoid crashing into the ocean or the Jacklyn recovery platform."
"Massive ice core is a ‘time machine’ that could help solve an ancient climate mystery, scientists say",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/science/antarctica-deep-ice-core/index.html,"An international research team has successfully drilled and retrieved a 9,186-foot-long (2,800-meter-long) ice core from Antarctica that dates back 1.2 million years. The sample extended so deep that it reached the bedrock beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet. The core, nearly as long as 25 soccer fields end to end or six and a half times taller than the Empire State Building to the very tip of its antenna, is a “time machine” that captures “an extraordinary archive of Earth’s climate,” said Carlo Barbante, coordinator of the Beyond EPICA, or European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica, team that collected the core. The team has sliced the core into 3.2-foot (1-meter) pieces stored in insulated boxes so they may be studied, said Barbante, professor at Italy’s Ca’ Foscari University of Venice and senior associate member of the Institute of Polar Sciences of the National Research Council of Italy. The core was collected from Little Dome C, one of the harshest and most extreme locations on the planet. The site is 21 miles (34 kilometers) from the Italian-French Concordia research station and is constantly slammed with strong wind gusts and near-constant temperatures below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius). The ice, some of the oldest drilled on Earth, could provide answers to the biggest remaining questions about how the planet’s climate has changed over time. “The air bubbles trapped within the ice core provide a direct snapshot of past atmospheric composition, including greenhouse gas concentrations like carbon dioxide and methane,” Barbante said via email. “By analyzing these, we can reconstruct how Earth’s climate responded to changes in climate forcing factors, such as solar radiation, volcanic activity, and orbital variations. This data helps us understand the intricate relationship between greenhouse gases and global temperature over hundreds of thousands of years and now down to 1.2 million year(s) and hopefully beyond.” Scientists are also hoping the ice will shed light on what caused the timing of Earth’s ice ages to shift suddenly about 1 million years ago, an event that nearly caused the extinction of ancient human ancestors, according to recent research. Researchers collected the core during the fourth campaign of the Beyond EPICA — Oldest Ice project, funded by the European Commission. The campaign took place over the most recent Antarctic summer between mid-November to mid-January. Overall, experts from 12 European scientific institutions have spent more than 200 days drilling and processing the ice during the last four summers. The program builds on the goals of the initial EPICA project that took place from 1996 to 2008. During that time, researchers drilled a deep ice core that unearthed links between climate and atmospheric greenhouse gases over the past 800,000 years. The core collected during the latest campaign marks a new milestone, creating a continuous record of Earth’s climate that dates back even further. Studies of the original EPICA core showed that Earth’s climate experienced a 100,000-year cycle of cold glacial periods, or ice ages, interspersed with warmer periods. But this finding didn’t match up with marine sediments that revealed Earth once experienced 41,000-year glacial periods prior to 1 million years ago. The Beyond EPICA project began in 2016 with the goal of finding older ice that could point to why this shift occurred, and the search for the right site started with the use of radar surveys. Radio echo sounding technologies helped team members zero in on ice that might contain the time capsule they were looking for, said Frank Wilhelms, principal investigator in the field and joint professor at Göttingen University and the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany. “We needed a Goldilocks site — ice thick enough for a well-resolved climate record at the greatest depth, but not too thick that the oldest ice had already melted away,” said Dr. Robert Mulvaney, a glaciologist and paleoclimatologist at the British Antarctic Survey. “This can happen when the heat escaping from the Earth’s mantle is trapped by a thick insulating blanket of ice. If the ice is too thick, we can lose the lowest and oldest layers of ice to melting,” Mulvaney said. “That’s why we spent a lot of effort in surveying the candidate areas to find the right site before drilling started.” Little Dome C is high on the central Antarctic plateau, reaching an altitude of 10,498 feet (3,200 meters) above sea level, presenting numerous challenges. The team had to work to prevent drill failures and ensure that the electromechanical core drill  was progressing through the ice layers. Each meter of ice can contain as many as 13,000 years of climate data, said Julien Westhoff, chief scientist in the field and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. When the team members retrieved the core, they found what they were looking for. The bottommost 688 feet (210 meters) of the core above the bedrock consists of old ice that has been heavily deformed, likely mixed, refrozen and of unknown origin, the team said. Analyzing the ice could help to test theories about how it refroze beneath the ice sheet. Researchers will also determine whether even older ice, such as that from the pre-Quaternary Period 2.58 million years ago, is present and provide dating of the rocks beneath the ice to determine when this Antarctic region was last ice-free. “It was exciting to see the ice age as we drilled deeper, and especially when we knew we were drilling ice older than the EPICA record, which ended at 800,000 years ago,” the British Antarctic Survey’s Mulvaney said in a statement. “This record of 1.2 million years will give us several 41,000-year glacial cycles to compare with the more recent data from the original EPICA core.” The Mid-Pleistocene Transition, which occurred between 1.2 million and 900,000 years ago, marks the fundamental shift in Earth’s glacial cycles, Barbante said. “This transition remains a scientific mystery, particularly regarding the role of greenhouse gases and ice sheet dynamics,” he said. “The Beyond EPICA ice core offers an unprecedented opportunity to directly measure atmospheric conditions during this pivotal period, potentially unlocking answers about why this transition occurred and how it shaped our planet’s climate system.” During the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, ice ages became longer and more intense, leading to a drop in temperature and dry climatic conditions. The global population also dropped to about 1,280 reproducing individuals between 930,000 and 813,000 years ago and then remained that small for about 117,000 years, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Science. The study authors argue this event “brought human ancestors close to extinction,” but others are more skeptical. Regardless, the ice core could contain evidence as to why the shift in the length of ice age periods occurred. Ice cores contain layers of snowfall that have been compressed over time, trapping air bubbles and particles that can be analyzed to reveal how Earth’s temperature and atmosphere have shifted. They could help scientists understand how Earth’s climate has behaved in the past to better predict how things may change in the future — and provide context on how our planet responds to different greenhouse gas concentrations. “Antarctic ice cores are like Rosetta Stones,” said Jim White, Craver Family Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an email. “They are unique in that they speak the language of temperature as well as the language of (carbon dioxide) levels, allowing us to see how these two key climate variables interact.” White was not involved in retrieving the ice core. But he said the ice has the potential to yield a great deal of information “about the fundamental dynamics of climate change on our planet, and the importance of that cannot be overstated.” While preliminary analysis occurred at the site, the ice core slices will be transported back to Europe aboard the icebreaker ship Laura Bassi in specialized cold containers to maintain the perfect temperature. Barbante anticipates that the research will be a multiyear endeavor as scientists take a deep dive into measuring concentrations of gas and dust particles within the ice. Meanwhile, the Beyond EPICA project, as well as other international associations, will search for older ice that could reveal longer climate records. But such efforts will require more advanced technology and planning, Barbante said. “We have to find other places in Antarctica where we can retrieve continuous climate record(s) similar to the one we are studying,” he said."
"Astronomers have for decades tried to figure out how Pluto captured its largest moon. Now, there’s a new theory",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/science/pluto-charon-kiss-capture-collision/index.html,"For decades, astronomers have tried to determine how Pluto acquired its unusually large moon Charon, which is about half the size of the dwarf planet. Now, new research suggests that Pluto and Charon briefly came together billions of years ago in a newly discovered “kiss and capture” collision. Scientists have long theorized that Charon formed much like Earth’s moon, which was created after a Mars-size object slammed into our planet. The impact sent molten debris from Earth flying into space, which eventually came together in orbit around our world and cooled to form the moon. But these theories didn’t account for the fact that Pluto and Charon may have more structural integrity as icy, rocky bodies on the frigid edge of the solar system. “Pluto and Charon are different — they’re smaller, colder and made primarily of rock and ice,” said Adeene Denton, lead study author of the research published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience. Instead, Pluto and Charon likely remained much the same after they collided, spinning together to form an object shaped like a cosmic snowman before separating into the binary system they have today, the study authors said. Binary systems form when two celestial bodies orbit around a common center of mass, like figure skaters who spin while holding hands, according to the authors. “Most planetary collision scenarios are classified as ‘hit and run’ or ‘graze and merge,’” said Denton, a NASA postdoctoral program fellow at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. “What we’ve discovered is something entirely different — a ‘kiss and capture’ scenario where the bodies collide, stick together briefly and then separate while remaining gravitationally bound.” (Denton conducted the research as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.) This new type of celestial collision uncovered by Denton and her colleagues could shed light on how planets form and evolve as well as how other bodies in the outer reaches of our solar system gained their own moons. And the new research may offer evidence for a subsurface ocean beneath Pluto’s icy crust. Charon and Earth’s moon are both a large fraction of the size of the main body they orbit, which is unlike other smaller moons orbiting planets throughout our solar system. (Pluto has four smaller moons besides Charon.) For example, Mars is orbited by two tiny potato-shaped moons called Phobos and Deimos, which are likely two asteroids that were captured by the red planet’s gravity. But that type of formation is unlikely for objects as large as our moon or Charon, Denton said. Other examples of collisions are the hit and run, when an impactor hits a planet and keeps going, or the graze and merge, when an object strikes a planet and they come together, Denton said. Simpler models from the early 2000s simulating how Pluto and Charon came to be in their current orientation supported the idea that some object collided with Pluto to create Charon. In that scenario, the colliding material was regarded as a strengthless fluid, meaning Pluto and Charon would have resembled two swirling, bending blobs, like in a lava lamp, Denton said. Within the last five years, there have been advancements in simulations for impact formation models, which allowed researchers to include material strength properties of celestial bodies — such as Pluto as a rocky core covered in ice. Pluto contains more rock than ice, while Charon is 50% rock and 50% ice, Denton said. When Denton and her colleagues simulated a collision including the structural properties of Pluto and Charon, they were better able to determine the impact momentum exchanged between both bodies as well as the end result. While Pluto and Charon likely exchanged some material during the impact, both remained largely intact because of their composition, sticking together to form a snowman-like figure and rotating as one body until Pluto essentially pushed Charon into a more distant orbit over time. “We were definitely surprised by the ‘kiss’ part of kiss-and-capture,” Denton said in an email. “There hasn’t really been a kind of impact before where the two bodies only temporarily merge before re-separating.” The findings suggest that Charon could be as ancient as Pluto. Researchers aren’t entirely sure when the impact occurred, but it likely happened about 4 billion years ago, early on in the history of the solar system, which is estimated to be 4.6 billion years old. “We know that it happened fairly early on, because that’s when giant collisions happened — and by early, I mean in the tens of millions of years after solar system formation, around the same time as the (formation of Earth’s moon),” Denton said. The study is a “great example of advances in numerical geophysics,” said Dr. Katarina Miljkovic, professor and deputy head of the School of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Curtin University in Australia. She was not involved in the new research. “They provide an elegant solution to the origin of the Pluto-Charon system, where by treating the physical properties of the planetary bodies with higher fidelity resulted in a more feasible impact and capture scenario for the origin of this system,” Miljkovic wrote in an email. Pluto belongs to a group of objects that distantly orbit the sun called the Kuiper Belt, where thousands of icy remnants left over from the formation of the solar system linger. Eight of the 10 largest Kuiper Belt Objects have large moons like Charon, Denton said, which means that “kiss and capture” collisions may have occurred across the Kuiper Belt as the solar system formed. “Adding more physical realism to the impact models — which we sometimes have to wait on while technology catches up with the complexity of the natural world — changed the answer and opened up a new suite of possible histories for Pluto, Charon, and a host of other Kuiper Belt Objects,” said Alyssa Rhoden, a staff scientist at the Southwest Research Institute, in an email. Rhoden and Denton both began working through the NASA Astrobiology Postdoctoral Program in September, but Rhoden was not part of the Pluto study. Some scientists suspect an ocean could lie beneath Pluto’s thick crust of ice, but questions have been raised about how such an ocean could form in this frigid world. The new collision scenario supports the formation of an ocean because such impacts heat up celestial bodies, Denton said. For example, Charon’s collision with Pluto would have raised the temperature of the the dwarf planet’s ice shell, which may have caused it to melt and form a subsurface ocean. Rhoden said she is curious whether such changes also occurred on other Kuiper Belt Objects with large moons. “Is there something special about the Charon-forming impact — or the characteristics of Pluto and the impactor — that led Pluto to become a rare (Kuiper Belt Object) ocean world?” Rhoden said. It’s also possible that after Charon separated from Pluto, moving from a close orbit to a more distant one, both bodies would have experienced tidal heating. This process occurs when the interiors of planets or moons are heated due to the gravitational forces between two bodies in orbit. “This is important because we’re not sure what thermal conditions Pluto may have possessed prior to impact,” Denton said. “If Pluto formed as a colder body without an ocean, then the giant impact may provide the key tipping point to then push Pluto towards forming and sustaining a subsurface ocean.”"
Nearly 200 Jurassic footprints unearthed on ‘dinosaur highway’,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/science/jurassic-footprints-dinosaur-highway-uk/index.html,"Scientists have unearthed nearly 200 dinosaur footprints, dating back 166 million years to the Middle Jurassic Period, at Dewars Farm Quarry in Oxfordshire, England. The remarkable find, first spied in 2023 when quarry worker Gary Johnson sensed “unusual bumps” on the ground while extracting limestone for road construction, has been nicknamed the “dinosaur highway” as a nod to the extensive pathways left by these prehistoric creatures. While other Jurassic pathways have been documented globally, the recent “highway” discovery in Oxfordshire is the largest known dinosaur track site in the United Kingdom. Around 100 volunteers from the University of Birmingham and the University of Oxford collaborated this past June for one week, excavating the tracks and recording as much information as possible about the expansive site. The discovery holds particular significance as it aligns with the 200th anniversary of the first-ever described dinosaur, the Megalosaurus, which was found in Oxfordshire in 1824. “There’s a really long legacy in this area of exciting dinosaur tracks and body fossils,” said Kirsty Edgar, a professor of micropaleontology at the University of Birmingham in England who was involved with the excavation. The recently uncovered tracks connect to a previously discovered dinosaur path in the same Oxfordshire quarry back in 1997, but it’s no longer accessible. However, with advancements in technology, the new trackways will provide scientists with an opportunity to analyze previously unavailable information about these extinct animals and unlock secrets about their movements, dietary habits and social dynamics. During the excavation, scientists uncovered five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous pathway measuring more than 150 meters in length (492 feet), according to a University of Birmingham news release. Four of these paths contained tracks from colossal, long-necked, four-legged herbivorous dinosaurs of the subgroup known as sauropods — most likely Cetiosaurus, which reached up to 18 meters (59 feet) in length, with the largest tracks measuring 90 centimeters (around 35 inches) long, according to Edgar. Lawrence Tanner, a paleoecologist and professor of biological and environmental sciences at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York, likened sauropods to modern elephants due to their massive size and herbivorous diet. He explained that most of the tracks were from hind legs, noting that, similar to elephants, sauropods’ hind feet were larger and often stepped over the impressions left by their front feet. “The general rule of locomotion is that the faster the animal is moving, the farther apart the footprints will be,” Tanner, who was not involved in the excavation, said. The fifth pathway contained prints from the Megalosaurus, a massive predatory dinosaur known for its distinctive, three-toed feet. Megalosaurus is believed to be up to 9 meters in length (30 feet), and in Oxfordshire, researchers found 65-centimeter (2.1-foot) long footprints. From the footprints, researchers were also able to determine the direction and speed at which the dinosaurs were moving. Most of the giants were moving northeast at an average speed of around 5 kilometers per hour (3 miles per hour), which is comparable to the pace of a human walking, Edgar said. Scientists believe larger theropods, such as the Megalosaurus, lacked running capabilities, unlike their smaller theropod counterparts, which possibly had the ability to run at fast speeds. Tanner said this theropod seemed to be moving at a leisurely pace, as indicated by the footprints. Researchers noted that the Megalosaurus path intersected with the sauropod trackways, suggesting the predator moved through the area shortly after the herbivores. While it’s difficult to pinpoint where the dinosaurs were headed, Tanner indicated they may have been traveling along the shoreline to navigate around trees or to search for food sources. The preservation of such an expansive ancient trackway is rare and was made possible by the unique conditions of the land during this time frame of the Jurassic Period. The distinct footprints indicate the area was once covered in soft sediment, with an ideal amount of water to conserve the impressions. Edgar compared the site’s ancient environment to the Florida Keys, with its carbonate mud banks and nearby water source. The tracks were also quickly covered, likely by a storm, protecting them from erosion caused by wind, water or other animals, according to Edgar. While Jurassic bone discoveries often draw significant attention, dinosaur tracks provide more specific insights into the lives of these extinct animals, Edgar said. Unlike bones, which can be transported to different areas by wind, water or scavengers, footprints remain in the exact locations where they were made. Tracks not only indicate the size of the dinosaurs but also provide clues about their behavior, such as group dynamics and predator-prey interactions. If well-preserved, the impressions can also shed light on how these creatures reacted to environmental changes, according to Tanner. “It’s like a snapshot into the day of the (dinosaurs’) life, and what they were doing,” Edgar said. During the excavation, researchers captured more than 20,000 images of the footprints with aerial drone photography. The team will use these images to create detailed 3D models to further investigate the interactions and biomechanics of the dinosaurs. Over the next six months to a year, researchers will be working to quickly analyze the data collected and prepare to release their findings to the public. “We have these 3D models for the first time, which means that anyone, as soon as we publish them, will be able to see the site and (its) legacy,” Edgar said. As a result of the limited time researchers had to document the site to prevent further disruptions to the quarry site, Edgar noted that a large portion of the surface remains unexplored, potentially offering even more information about the diverse creatures that once roamed the area. “As quarrying continues, as long as we can, I think we’ll be continuously evaluating and working with the quarry workers as new areas are exposed,” Edgar said. “We would hope to be doing excavations each summer.”"
"Once celebrated, an inventor’s breakthroughs are now viewed as disasters — and the world is still recovering",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/thomas-midgley-jr-leaded-gas-freon-scn/index.html,"Facing a crowd of journalists, inventor Thomas Midgley Jr. poured a lead additive over his hands and then proceeded to inhale its fumes for about a minute. Unfazed, he said, “I could do this every day without getting any health problems whatsoever.” Soon afterward, Midgley needed medical treatment. But the act would have dire consequences beyond his own well-being. The year was 1924, and Midgley, then a chemical engineer for General Motors, had pulled the stunt to support his most recent, lucrative finding: a lead compound called tetraethyl lead. Added to gasoline, it solved one of the biggest problems the automotive industry faced at the time — engine knocking, or tiny explosions in car engines due to the low quality of gasoline that resulted in an annoying sound and potential damage. Lead helped, but at great expense, because the substance is highly toxic to humans, especially children. Midgley would go on to leave his mark in history with another destructive invention, also a solution to a problem: the need to replace the noxious and flammable gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning. He found that CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, were an ideal substitute and harmless to humans. However, they turned out to be deadly to the ozone in the atmosphere, which blocks dangerous ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancers and other health problems, as well as harming plants and animals. One hundred years after that stunt before the press in 1924, the planet is still recovering from the ill effects of both of Midgley’s inventions. The ozone layer will need another four decades to heal fully, and because leaded gasoline was still sold in parts of the world until 2021, many continue to live with the long-term effects of lead poisoning. Yet Midgley — whose story will be told in an upcoming movie developed by the writer of the 2013 film “The Wolf of Wall Street” — was hailed as a hero for decades. Born in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, in 1889, Midgley had a penchant for finding useful applications for known substances early on. In high school, he used the chewed bark of the slippery elm trees to give baseballs a more curved trajectory, a practice professional players would later pick up. He was known to carry with him at all times a copy of the periodic table, his main tool in the search for the substance that would mark his breakthrough invention. The task of addressing the issue of engine knocking fell to Midgley while he was working at General Motors in 1916. “It was the dawn of the automobile era in the United States, and Ford had developed the Model T, which was not very powerful,” said Gerald Markowitz, a history professor at the City University of New York. “GM joined with Standard Oil and DuPont to try to develop more powerful engines, and in order to do that they needed to solve the problem of the engines knocking with the fuel that they had at the time.” Under the direction of Charles Kettering, another influential American inventor and head of research at GM, Midgley worked his way through thousands of substances — including arsenic, sulfur and silicon — in a quest to find one that reduced knocking when added to gasoline. He eventually landed on tetraethyl lead, a lead derivative that was marketed simply as Ethyl. Leaded gasoline first went on sale in Dayton, Ohio, in 1923 and eventually spread throughout the world. Lead is highly poisonous, with no safe level of exposure, and can impair development in children, causing decreased intelligence and behavioral disorders, according to UNICEF. An estimated 1 million people a year still die from lead poisoning, according to the World Health Organization. The toxicity of lead was already well-known when Midgley added it to gas, but that didn’t stop Ethyl from becoming a commercial success. “There were alarms that were raised, because lead was known as a toxin,” Markowitz said. “But the position of the industry was that there was no proof that lead coming out of the tailpipes of cars was going to injure people. And it was that lack of proof that ultimately led the surgeon general not to take action after a public health conference in 1925.” However, workers in Ethyl manufacturing quickly experienced ill effects. “It was really the fact that the people working in the labs producing tetraethyl lead were getting sick that created a crisis,” Markowitz said. “They would literally go insane as a result of their exposure to lead.” Midgley went as far as pouring Ethyl over his hands and inhaling it during that 1924 news conference in an attempt to quench fears. But in reality, he was also getting poisoned. “He definitely wrote in a letter in January of 1923 that he had a touch of lead poisoning, and he did have lead poisoning for the rest of his life,” said Bill Kovarik, a professor of communication at Radford University in Virginia. “It doesn’t really go away when you get that much lead in your body. It is a serious, long-term disability.” Just years after the invention of Ethyl, Midgley — again spurred by Kettering — turned his attention to developing a nontoxic, nonflammable alternative to refrigerant gases such as ammonia, which were used in appliances and air conditioners at the time, leading to a series of fatal accidents in the 1920s. He came up with Freon — a derivative of methane, composed of carbon, chlorine and fluorine atoms — the first CFC. In another public demonstration, in 1930, Midgley inhaled the gas and blew out a candle with it, a move designed to show its safety. Freon, as well as subsequent CFCs, became commercial successes, and made air conditioning adoption shoot up in the United States. After World War II, manufacturers started routinely using CFCs as propellants for all sorts of products, including insecticides and hair spray. It was the mid-1970s, three decades after Midgley’s death, before the damage from his two inventions became publicly known. CFCs had punched a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica; if left unchecked, the hole would have expanded to the point of eventually threatening all life on Earth. As a result of continued industry pressure, leaded gasoline was not phased out in the United States until 1996 and slowly thereafter throughout the world. The last nation to get rid of it, Algeria, still sold it until 2021, and lead additives continue to be used in aviation fuel. A 2022 study estimated that half of the current US population had been exposed to dangerous levels of lead in early childhood, but the damage to the world’s collective health is harder to quantify. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was signed to phase out CFCs from 1989 until 2010, after which they were banned. (CFC emissions have been rising again recently, a sign that they may still be produced illegally.) The hole in the ozone layer is on the mend and will likely heal in the next half–century in a rare environmental win. “The very sad truth is that we don’t know especially the number of children who have been adversely affected,” Markowitz said. “There is no safe level of lead in a child’s body. We’re talking tens of millions of children, hundreds of millions of children over a half-century or more that have been affected adversely, their life chances diminished from lead dust as a result of the exhaust gases that got into the ground or into the streets.” Midgley’s life ended under tragic circumstances. After contracting polio in 1940, he became severely disabled and devised yet another invention: a machine that would lift him out of bed and into a wheelchair autonomously, via strings and pulleys. But on November 2, 1944, he became entangled in the machine and died of strangulation. For a long time, it was believed to have been the ultimate irony — the inventor dying by his own invention. But the reality may be even darker, according to Kovarik. “The official cause of death was suicide,” he said. “He had a tremendous sense of guilt. The industry told him he was brilliant. But he did stuff that in hindsight was pretty irresponsible. The lead poisoning could have contributed to his psychosis.” Midgley received several awards and honors in the late stages of his life. The Society of Chemical Industry awarded him the Perkin Medal in 1937; the American Chemical Society gave him the Priestley Medal in 1941 and elected him as president in the year of his death. A biographical memoir from the National Academy of Sciences, written by his mentor Kettering in 1947, contains nothing but praise and ends by saying that Midgley left behind “a great heritage to the world from a busy, a diversified, and a highly creative life.” History has other examples of inventions that turned out to be unwittingly deadly, such as TNT, which was originally developed for use as a yellow dye and not used as an explosive until decades later. Midgley is unique in having developed two such inventions, but although it’s tempting to see him as an environmental villain, experts say his role was more akin to a cog in the machine. “He was just an employee,” Kovarik said. Markowitz agrees. “This was corporate-sponsored research,” he said. “Had it not been Midgley, I’m sure it would have been somebody else who would have come up with these solutions.” Striving for growth and innovation at all costs was reflective of the conception of progress in the first half of the 20th century, Markowitz added. “Only with the environmental movement that started in the 1960s and 1970s did we begin to consider what the consequences of technological progress could be,” he said. “That has had a really sobering effect, but up through the 1950s there were very few voices questioning the idea that progress was our most important product.”"
‘Dyson spheres’ were theorized as a way to detect alien life. Scientists say they’ve found potential evidence,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/dyson-spheres-alien-life-evidence-scn/index.html,"What would be the ultimate solution to the energy problems of an advanced civilization? Renowned British American physicist Freeman Dyson theorized it would be a shell made up of mirrors or solar panels that completely surrounds a star — harnessing all the energy it produces. “One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star,” wrote Dyson in a 1960 paper in which he first explained the concept. If it sounds like science fiction, that’s because it is: Dyson took the idea from Olaf Stapledon’s 1937 novel “Star Maker,” and he was always open about that. The late scientist was a professor emeritus at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Still, coming from a thinker who some in the scientific community say might have been worthy of a Nobel Prize early in his career, the concept took hold and the hypothetical megastructures became known as Dyson spheres, even though the physicist later clarified that they would actually consist of “a loose collection or swarm of objects traveling on independent orbits around the star.” In his paper, Dyson also noted that Dyson spheres would give off waste heat detectable as infrared radiation, and suggested that looking for that byproduct would be a viable method for searching for extraterrestrial life. However, he added that infrared radiation by itself would not necessarily mean extraterrestrial intelligence, and that one of the strongest reasons for searching for such sources was that new types of natural astronomical objects might be discovered. “Scientists (at the time) were largely receptive, not to the likelihood that alien civilisations would be found to exist, but that a search for waste heat would be a good place to look,” said George Dyson, a technology writer and author and the second of Dyson’s six children, via email. “Science fiction, from ‘Footfall’ to ‘Star Trek,’ took the idea and ran with it, while social critics adopted the Dyson sphere as a vehicle for questioning the wisdom of unlimited technological growth.” The elder Dyson himself argued, “It would be much more rewarding to search directly for intelligence, but technology is the only thing we have any chance of seeing.” In the 1960s, there was no way to actually search for Dyson spheres, but in more recent times many researchers have looked for them, including those at the SETI Institute, a nonprofit organization with a mission to search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, known as Fermilab. Now, a new study that looked at 5 million stars in the Milky Way galaxy suggests that seven candidates could potentially be hosting Dyson spheres — a finding that’s attracting scrutiny and alternate theories. The authors of the study, published May 6 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, specifically set out to search for Dyson spheres, in the form of infrared heat near stars that couldn’t be explained in any other way. Using historical data from telescopes that pick up infrared signatures, the research team looked at stars located within less than 1,000 light-years from Earth: “We started with a sample of 5 million stars, and we applied filters to try to get rid of as much data contamination as possible,” said lead study author Matías Suazo, a doctoral student in the department of physics and astronomy of Uppsala University in Sweden. “So far, we have seven sources that we know are glowing in the infrared but we don’t know why, so they stand out.” There is no conclusive evidence that the seven stars have Dyson spheres around them, Suazo cautioned. “It’s difficult for us to find an explanation for these sources, because we don’t have enough data to prove what is the real cause of the infrared glow,” he said. “They could be Dyson spheres, because they behave like our models predict, but they could be something else as well.” Among the natural causes that could explain the infrared glow are an unlucky alignment in the observation, with a galaxy in the background overlapping with the star, planetary collisions creating debris, or the fact that the stars may be young and therefore still surrounded by disks of hot debris from which planets would later form. The data used by the researchers comes from two active space telescopes — the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, from NASA and Gaia from the European Space Agency — as well as an astronomical survey of the sky in infrared light called The Two Micron All Sky Survey. Also known as 2MASS, the collaboration between the University of Massachusetts and the US space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory took place between 1997 and 2001. The candidate stars are all red dwarfs, the most common type of star in our galaxy. They are also dimmer and smaller than our sun, which makes follow-up observations more difficult. It’s unclear at this point whether the stars have planets around them, as they haven’t been observed yet by any of the telescopes that could potentially spot orbiting planets. However, many of the thousands of exoplanets scientists have identified so far orbit red dwarfs, which makes their presence likely; planets orbiting red dwarfs have a higher chance of being inhabitable, according to NASA. An earlier study, published in March and using data from the same sources as the new report, had also found infrared anomalies among a sample dataset of 5 million stars in our galaxy. “We got 53 candidates for anomalies that cannot be well explained, but can’t say that all of them are Dyson sphere candidates, because that’s not what we are specifically looking for,” said Gabriella Contardo, a postdoctoral research fellow at the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy, who led the earlier study. She added that she plans to check the candidates against Suazo’s model to see how many tie into it. “You need to eliminate all other hypotheses and explanations before saying that they could be a Dyson sphere,” she added. “To do so you need to also rule out that it’s not some kind of debris disk, or some kind of planetary collision, and that also pushes the science forward in other fields of astronomy — so it’s a win-win.” Both Contardo and Suazo agree that more research is needed on the data, and that ultimately they could turn to NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope for more information, as it is powerful enough to observe the candidate stars directly. However, because of the lengthy, competitive procedures that regulate use of the telescope, securing access might take some time. If Dyson spheres really exist, what could they be used for? “If you picture ourselves having as much energy as the sun is providing every second, we could do unheard of things,” Suazo said. “We could do interstellar travel, maybe we could even move the entire solar system to our preferred location, if we wanted.” But don’t hold your breath, because the technology and the raw materials required to build the hypothetical structures are far beyond humanity’s grasp. “They are so big that everything we have on Earth would not be enough to build them,” Suazo added. “Freeman Dyson said that we should dismantle Jupiter — the whole planet (for the raw materials).” That supercolossal scale probably means that Dyson spheres, if they exist at all, are very rare. “The importance of this work is that it provides the first strong evidence that there are not a lot of Dyson Spheres in our galaxy, contrary to the expectations of some that they might be an inevitable end-state of technological species’ expansion out into their solar systems,” said study coauthor Jason Wright, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State University, via email. “The candidates Matías (Suazo) has found are important because whatever they are — and they are likely stars surrounded by material from some sort of rare event, like a planetary collision, although they could be Dyson spheres — they are rare and interesting objects worthy of further study, for instance by the James Webb Space Telescope.” Dyson died in 2020 before any of his spheres could be found — although they are just one of a dozen ideas that bear his name. “As a young scientist, Dyson showed that three competing quantum theories were actually the same theory — he summarily ended the competition,” said William Press, the Leslie Surginer Professor of Computer Science and Integrative Biology at the University of Texas at Austin. He was not involved in the study. “Later, he applied his genius to areas of astronomy, cosmology, the extraterrestrial realm, and also the very real problem of nuclear proliferation here on planet Earth. At the time of his death, he was recognized as a provocative and creative thinker.” George Dyson also attested to his father’s fascination and comprehensive reach across disciplines. “Taking advantage of a short attention span and an aversion to bureaucracy, he contributed to five fields of mathematics and eleven fields of physics, as well as to theoretical biology, engineering, operations research, literature, and public affairs,” the younger Dyson said. “Many of his ideas were controversial, with one of his guiding principles being that ‘It is better to be wrong than to be vague.’” The approach of the researchers behind the new study could offer a more fruitful path in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, said Tomotsugu Goto, an associate professor of astronomy at the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. He also was not involved with the study. “However, contamination by circumstellar debris disks, which mimic Dyson Sphere infrared signatures, remains a concern,” he added in an email. “Authors argue that the debris disks around (dwarf stars) are rare, but the 7 candidate authors selected out of 5 million sources are also rare. Despite this, the seven candidates warrant further investigation with powerful telescopes for a more definitive evaluation.” A May 23 paper published in response to the one by Suazo and his colleagues suggests that at least three of the seven stars have been “misidentified” as Dyson spheres and could instead be “hot DOGs” — hot dust-obscured galaxies — and that the remaining four could probably be explained this way as well. Because Suazo’s study touches on the fundamental question of whether humankind is alone in the universe, the search for Dyson candidates straddles different fields — including basic sciences, philosophy and religion — and might therefore increase the involvement of young scientists and the interest of the scientific world in the topic, according to Zaza Osmanov, an affiliate of SETI and associate dean of the School of Physics at the Free University of Tbilisi in Georgia, who also was not involved with the research. However, he added, the radiation fingerprint of the seven Dyson sphere candidates might be explained by natural phenomena as well. “The hypothesis of the artificial origin of any, even very interesting, radiation, should be the last springboard when all possible natural explanations are exhausted,” Osmanov said. “And for this, future research is necessary.” As for Dyson himself, if he were still alive, he also would be highly skeptical that these observations represent a technological signature, his son George argued: “But the discovery of new, non-technological astronomical phenomena is exactly why he thought we should go out and look.”"
Why scientists say we need to send clocks to the moon — soon,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/30/science/lunar-time-zone-scale-nasa-artemis-scn/index.html,"Perhaps the greatest, mind-bending quirk of our universe is the inherent trouble with timekeeping: Seconds tick by ever so slightly faster atop a mountain than they do in the valleys of Earth. For practical purposes, most people don’t have to worry about those differences. But a renewed space race has the United States and its allies, as well as China, dashing to create permanent settlements on the moon, and that has brought the idiosyncrasies of time, once again, to the forefront. On the lunar surface, a single Earth day would be roughly 56 microseconds shorter than on our home planet — a tiny number that can lead to significant inconsistencies over time. NASA and its international partners are currently grappling with this conundrum. Scientists aren’t just looking to create a new “time zone” on the moon, as some headlines have suggested, said Cheryl Gramling, the lunar position, navigation, and timing and standards lead at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Rather, the space agency and its partners are looking to create an entirely new “time scale,” or system of measurement that accounts for that fact that seconds tick by faster on the moon, Gramling noted. The agency’s goal is to work with international partners to set up a new method of tracking time, specifically for the moon, that space-faring nations agree to observe. A recent memo from the White House also directed NASA to map out its plans for this new time scale by December 31, calling it “foundational” to renewed US efforts to explore the lunar surface. The memo also asks that NASA implement such a system by the end of 2026, the same year the space agency is aiming to return astronauts to the moon for the first time in five decades. For the world’s timekeepers, the coming months could be crucial for figuring out how to accurately keep lunar time — and reach agreements on how, when and where to put clocks on the moon. Such a framework will be crucial for humans visiting our closest celestial neighbor, Gramling told CNN. Astronauts on the moon, for example, are going to leave their habitats to explore the surface and carry out science investigations, she said. They’re also going to be communicating with one another or driving their moon buggies while on the lunar surface. “When they’re navigating relative to the moon,” Gramling said, “time needs to be relative to the moon.” Simple sundials or stone formations, which track shadows as the sun passes overhead, mark a day’s progression just as the shifting phases of the moon can log the passing of a month on Earth. Those natural timekeepers have kept humans on schedule for millennia. But perhaps since mechanical clocks gained traction in the early 14th century, clockmakers have grown ever more persnickety about precision. Exacting the measurement of seconds also grew more complicated in the early 1900s, thanks to Albert Einstein, the German-born physicist who rocked the scientific community with his theories of special and general relativity. “Darn that Einstein guy — he came up with general relativity, and many strange things come out of it,” said Dr. Bruce Betts, chief scientist at The Planetary Society, a nonprofit space interest group. “One of them is that gravity slows time down.” General relativity is complicated, but in broad terms, it’s a framework that explains how gravity affects space and time. Imagine that our solar system is a piece of fabric suspended in the air. That fabric is space and time itself, which — under Einstein’s theories — are inextricably linked. And every celestial body within the solar system, from the sun to the planets, is like a heavy ball sitting atop the fabric. The heavier the ball, the deeper the divot it creates, warping space and time. Even the idea of an earthly “second” is a humanmade concept that’s tricky to measure. And it was Einstein’s theory of general relativity that explained why time passes slightly more slowly at lower elevations — because gravity has a stronger effect closer to a massive object (such as our home planet). Scientists have found a modern solution to all the complications of relativity for timekeeping on Earth: To account for imperceptible differences, they have set up a few hundred atomic clocks at various locations across the globe. Atomic clocks are ultra-precise instruments that use the vibration of atoms to measure the passage of time, and those clocks — in line with Einstein’s theories — tick slower the closer to Earth’s surface they sit. The readings from atomic clocks around the world can be averaged for a broad but accurate as possible sense of time for planet Earth as a whole, giving us Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC. Still, occasionally “leap seconds” are factored in to keep UTC in line with slight changes in Earth’s speed of rotation. This methodical keeping of time helps make the modern world go round — metaphorically speaking, said Kevin Coggins, deputy associate administrator and program manager for NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation Program. “If you’ve researched time on the Earth, you realize it is the critical enabler for everything: the economy, food security, trading, the financial community, even oil exploration. They use precise clocks,” Coggins said. “It’s in everything that matters in modern society.” If time moves differently on the peaks of mountains than the shores of the ocean, you can imagine that things get even more bizarre the farther away from Earth you travel. To add more complication: Time also passes slower the faster a person or spacecraft is moving, according to Einstein’s theory of special relativity. Astronauts on the International Space Station, for example, are lucky, said Dr. Bijunath Patla, a theoretical physicist with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, in a phone interview. Though the space station orbits about 200 miles (322 kilometers) above Earth’s surface, it also travels at high speeds — looping the planet 16 times per day — so the effects of relativity somewhat cancel each other out, Patla said. For that reason, astronauts on the orbiting laboratory can easily use Earth time to stay on schedule. For other missions — it’s not so simple. Fortunately, scientists already have decades of experience contending with the complexities. Spacecraft, for example, are equipped with their own clocks called oscillators, Gramling said. “They maintain their own time,” Gramling said. “And most of our operations for spacecraft — even spacecraft that are all the way out at Pluto, or the Kuiper Belt, like New Horizons — (rely on) ground stations that are back on Earth. So everything they’re doing has to correlate with UTC.” But those spacecraft also rely on their own kept time, Gramling said. Vehicles exploring deep into the solar system, for example, have to know — based on their own time scale — when they are approaching a planet in case the spacecraft needs to use that planetary body for navigational purposes, she added. For 50 years, scientists have also been able to observe atomic clocks that are tucked aboard GPS satellites, which orbit Earth about 12,550 miles (20,200 kilometers) away — or about one-nineteenth the distance between our planet and the moon. Studying those clocks has given scientists a great starting point to begin extrapolating further as they set out to establish a new time scale for the moon, Patla said. “We can easily compare (GPS) clocks to clocks on the ground,” Patla said, adding that scientists have found a way to gently slow GPS clocks down, making them tick more in-line with Earth-bound clocks. “Obviously, it’s not as easy as it sounds, but it’s easier than making a mess.” For the moon, however, scientists likely won’t seek to slow clocks down. They hope to accurately measure lunar time as it is — while also ensuring it can be related back to Earth time, according to Patla, who recently co-authored a paper detailing a framework for lunar time. The study, for the record, also attempted to pinpoint exactly how far apart moon and Earth time are, as estimates have wavered between 56 and 59 microseconds per day. Clocks on the moon’s equator would tick 56.02 microseconds faster per day than clocks at the Earth’s equator, according to the paper. What scientists know for certain is that they need to get precision timekeeping instruments to the moon. Exactly who pays for lunar clocks, which type of clocks will go, and where they’ll be positioned are all questions that remain up in the air, Gramling said. “We have to work all of this out,” she said. “I don’t think we know yet. I think it will be an amalgamation of several different things.” Atomic clocks, Gramling noted, are great for long-term stability, and crystal oscillators have an advantage for short-term stability. “You never trust one clock,” Gramling added. “And you never trust two clocks.” Clocks of various types could be placed inside satellites that orbit the moon or perhaps at the precise locations on the lunar surface that astronauts will one day visit. As for price, an atomic clock worthy of space travel could cost around a few million dollars, according Gramling, with crystal oscillators coming in substantially cheaper. But, Patla said, you get what you pay for. “The very cheap oscillators may be off by milliseconds or even 10s of milliseconds,” he added. “And that is important because for navigation purposes — we need to have the clocks synchronized to 10s of nanoseconds.” A network of clocks on the moon could work in concert to inform the new lunar time scale, just as atomic clocks do for UTC on Earth. (There will not, Gramling added, be different time zones on the moon. “There have been conversations about creating different zones, with the answer: ‘No,’” she said. “But that could change in the future.”) The new time scale would underpin an entire lunar network, which NASA and its allies have dubbed LunaNet. “You can think of LunaNet like the internet — or the internet and a global navigation satellite system all combined,” Gramling said. It’s “a framework of standards that contributors to LunaNet (such as NASA or the European Space Agency) would follow.” “And you can think of the contributors maybe as your internet service provider,” Gramling added. Creating such a framework means bringing a lot of people across the world to the table. So far, Gramling said, conversations with US partners have been “very, very positive.” It’s not clear whether NASA and its partners on this effort, which include the European Space Agency, will get a buy-in from nations that aren’t among US allies, such as China. Gramling noted those conversations would be held through international standard-setting bodies, such as the International Astronomical Union. Accurate clockwork is one matter. But how future astronauts living and working on the lunar surface will experience time is a different question entirely. On Earth, our sense of one day is governed by the fact that the planet completes one rotation every 24 hours, giving most locations a consistent cycle of daylight and darkened nights. On the moon, however, the equator receives roughly 14 days of sunlight followed by 14 days of darkness. “It’s just a very, very different concept” on the moon, Betts said. “And (NASA is) talking about landing astronauts in the very interesting south polar region (of the moon), where you have permanently lit and permanently shadowed areas. So, that’s a whole other set of confusion.” “It’ll be challenging” for those astronauts, Betts added. “It’s so different than Earth, and it’s just a whole different mindset.” That will be true no matter what time is displayed on the astronauts’ watches. Still, precision timekeeping matters — not just for the sake of scientifically understanding the passage of time on the moon but also for setting up all the infrastructure necessary to carry out missions. The beauty of creating a time scale from scratch, Gramling said, is that scientists can take everything they have learned about timekeeping on Earth and apply it to a new system on the moon. And if scientists can get it right on the moon, she added, they can get it right later down the road if NASA fulfills its goal of sending astronauts deeper into the solar system. “We are very much looking at executing this on the moon, learning what we can learn,” Gramling said, “so that we are prepared to do the same thing on Mars or other future bodies.”"

Scientist Dr. Randal Voss gets the occasional reminder that he’s working with a kind of superstar. When he does outreach events with his laboratory, he encounters people who are keen to meet his research subjects: aquatic salamanders called axolotls. The amphibians’ fans tell Voss that they know the animals from the internet, or from caricatures or stuffed animals, exclaiming, “‘They’re so adorable, we love them,’” said Voss, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. “People are drawn to them.” Take one look at an axolotl, and it’s easy to see why it’s so popular. With their wide eyes, upturned mouths and pastel pink coloring, axolotls look cheerful and vaguely Muppet-like. They’ve skyrocketed in pop culture fame, in part thanks to the addition of axolotls to the video game Minecraft in 2021. These unusual salamanders are now found everywhere from Girl Scout patches to hot water bottles. But there’s more to axolotls than meets the eye: Their story is one of scientific discovery, exploitation of the natural world, and the work to rebuild humans’ connection with nature. Axolotl is a word from Nahuatl, the Indigenous Mexican language spoken by the Aztecs and an estimated 1.5 million people today. The animals are named for the Aztec god Xolotl, who was said to transform into a salamander. The original Nahuatl pronunciation is “AH-show-LOAT”; in English, “ACK-suh-LAHT-uhl” is commonly used. Axolotls are members of a class of animals called amphibians, which also includes frogs. Amphibians lay their jelly-like eggs in water, and the eggs hatch into water-dwelling larval states. (In frogs, these larvae are called tadpoles.) Most amphibians, once they reach adulthood, are able to move to land. Since they breathe, in part, by absorbing oxygen through their moist skin, they tend to stay near water. Axolotls, however, never complete the metamorphosis to a land-dwelling adult form and spend their whole lives in the water. “They maintain their juvenile look throughout the course of their life,” Voss said. “They’re teenagers, at least in appearance, until they die.” A signature feature of the axolotls’ forever-young look is their frilled external gills, which help them breathe in their watery home — the only spot they’re found in the wild: Lake Xochimilco in Mexico City. It’s a bit of a scientific mystery why axolotls don’t transform into adult, land-dwelling versions of themselves. One hypothesis, according to Dr. Luis Zambrano, a professor of zoology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, is that the environment in Lake Xochimilco had enough resources for the salamanders that “it was by far better for them not to expend energy transforming and stay in the lake.” The 10-square-mile Lake Xochimilco is a unique body of water, a natural drainage basin with slightly salty water. More than 1,000 years ago, Xochimilca people in the region invented an agricultural system of human-made floating islands called chinampas. The chinampa system, with its drainage canals surrounding the islands, is still used by farmers called chinamperos today. The islands provided habitats and hiding places for the axolotls, which thrived among the chinampas for 1,000 years. However, the chinampas of Lake Xochimilco are no longer thriving, and neither are the salamanders. “The problems started at the beginning of the last century,” Zambrano said. As Mexico City grew and became more industrialized, the need for water brought pumps and pipes to the lake, and eventually, “it was like a bad, smelly pond with rotten water,” Zambrano said. “All of our aquatic animals suffer with bad water quality, but amphibians suffer more because they have to breathe with the skin.” To add to the axolotls’ problems, invasive fish species such as carp and tilapia were introduced to the lake, where they feed on axolotl eggs. And a 1985 earthquake in Mexico City displaced thousands of people, who found new homes in the area around the lake, further contributing to the destruction of the axolotls’ habitat. These combined threats have devastated axolotl populations. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, there are fewer than 100 adult axolotls left in the wild. The species is considered critically endangered. While the wild axolotls of Lake Xochimilco have dwindled to near-extinction, countless axolotls have been bred for scientific laboratories and the pet trade. “The axolotl essentially helped establish the field of experimental zoology,” Voss said. In 1864, a French army officer brought live axolotls back to Europe, where scientists were surprised to learn that the seemingly juvenile aquatic salamanders were capable of reproduction. Since then, scientists around the world have studied axolotls and their DNA to learn about the salamanders’ unusual metamorphosis (or lack thereof) as well as their ability to regrow injured body parts. In addition to their role in labs, axolotls have become popular in the exotic pet trade (though they are illegal to own in California, Maine, New Jersey and Washington, DC). However, the axolotls you might find at a pet shop are different from their wild relatives in Lake Xochimilco. Most wild axolotls are a dark grayish brown. The famous pink axolotls, as well as other color variants such as white, blue, yellow and black, are genetic anomalies that are rare in the wild but selectively bred for in the pet trade. What’s more, “most of the animals in the pet trade have a very small genetic variance,” Zambrano said. Pet axolotls tend to be inbred and lack the wide flow of different genes that makes up a healthy population in the wild. That means that the axolotl extinction crisis can’t simply be solved by dumping pet axolotls into Lake Xochimilco. (Plus, the pet axolotls likely wouldn’t fare well with the poor habitat conditions in the lake.) The difficulties that axolotls face in the wild are almost diametrically opposed to the fame they’ve found in recent years. Axolotls have captured the human imagination for centuries, as evidenced by their roles in Aztec religion and stories, but the early 21st century seems to be a high point for them. An axolotl graces the 50 peso bill. There are axolotl-inspired Pokemon, and Reddit commenters have noted that the character Toothless from the “How to Train Your Dragon” movie series is distinctly axolotl-like. The introduction of axolotls to Minecraft in 2021 neatly mapped onto an uptick in Google searches for the animals, and social media makes it easy for people to gain access to photos and videos of the salamanders, particularly the photogenic pink ones often kept as pets. The axolotl pet trade probably doesn’t directly harm the wild populations since wild salamanders aren’t being poached or taken from Lake Xochimilco. However, Zambrano said, axolotls’ ubiquity in pop culture and pet stores might make people assume that because axolotls “live in all the tanks around the world, they are not in danger.” Zambrano has been working in axolotl conservation for more than two decades. It’s a somewhat unusual challenge, he said, because axolotls live so closely to so many people, so the answer to saving them isn’t simply to create a wildlife preserve and keep people out. “We have to be inventive in terms of the new ways of restoration and resilience and sustainable decisions,” he said. These new practices include outreach efforts that aim for “synergy between local knowledge and scientific knowledge,” Zambrano said, especially among the chinamperos whose families have farmed the islands in Lake Xochimilco for generations. A widespread return to the chinampa system, he said, would benefit the axolotls, because it would ensure cleaner habitat space for the salamanders than the lake’s current, more industrial uses provide. Such efforts would require policy changes, but according to Zambrano, worldwide enthusiasm for the axolotls could bolster such a campaign. People who love them can even symbolically adopt an axolotl to help fund conservation programs. Getting people to recognize that their favorite, friendly faced salamander doesn’t just exist in the vacuum of the internet, but in the real world where it faces dire conservation challenges, Zambrano said, is “a huge achievement.” Kate Golembiewski is a freelance science writer based in Chicago who geeks out about zoology, thermodynamics and death.

NASA collected potential evidence of life on Mars. Now it’s pitching new plans to retrieve the cache,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/science/nasa-mars-sample-return-options/index.html,"Two new potential strategies for returning crucial samples from Mars to Earth by the 2030s are now on the table, according to NASA. The proposals present alternatives to the original Mars Sample Return program. Designed by NASA and the European Space Agency, the initial plan was deemed unwieldy after an independent review board projected it could cost up to $11 billion. The board’s assessment also pushed the expected return date of the samples from 2031 to 2040 — a delay that was “simply unacceptable,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson reiterated Tuesday. The agency will decide between the newly proposed strategies, intended to reduce complexity, cost and mission duration, by the second half of 2026, Nelson announced during a news conference on Tuesday. The NASA Perseverance rover has been gathering rocks and dust since it landed on Mars in February 2021. Scientists believe those samples — collected from Jezero Crater, the former site of an ancient lake and river delta — might be one of the only ways to determine whether life ever existed on the red planet. But returning the specimens to Earth, a feat that could answer one of humanity’s biggest questions about the potential for life beyond Earth, is a complex process. Both the original and new architecture for the program include multiple spacecraft that would be used to land on Mars and ferry the cache back to our planet. In April, NASA asked its various centers and industry partners to come up with new plans for getting the samples back to Earth in a more streamlined and cost-effective way. The agency’s Mars Sample Return Strategic Review team assessed 11 of the studies and made recommendations to NASA, which were then further refined by leadership. “We are exploring two new landing options,” said Dr. Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “One is to leverage technology that was previously used to land both (the) Perseverance and Curiosity (rovers) on Mars. The other is to leverage options from industry.” The first option will rely on the sky crane method, used for the entry descent and landing of the two rovers still exploring Mars. The second will utilize new commercial capabilities and partners to deliver a “heavy-lift vehicle” lander, such as designs from companies from SpaceX and Blue Origin, to Mars, Nelson said. Mars has long posed a challenge to landers because its thin atmosphere is thick enough to burn up a spacecraft that isn’t tucked within an outer structure sporting a protective heat shield. But the red planet’s atmosphere is also too thin to rely on parachutes alone to slow down and create a safe landing. For the deployment of the hefty car-size rover Curiosity, engineers created a system called the sky crane to secure the rover during entry, descent and landing. During the initial descent, a heat shield, parachute and retrorockets slowed down the spacecraft. Then, the sky crane lowered the rover to the surface of the red planet using a strong cable. Afterward, the sky crane disconnected and crash-landed away from the site. In 2021, the same design was used to land Perseverance, and the team was actually able to capture video of the daring descent. Mars Sample Return is humanity’s first mission to bring scientific samples from a habitable planet back to Earth, Fox said. “We want to bring those back as quickly as possible to study them in state-of-the-art facilities,” she said. “Mars Sample Return will allow scientists to understand the planet’s geological history and the evolution of climate on this barren planet where life may have existed in the past and shed light on the early solar system before life began here on Earth. This will also prepare us to safely send the first human explorers to Mars.” The agency will proceed with testing the viability of both options and working through the engineering challenges of each plan over the next year at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The newly proposed strategies provide the potential to return the samples to Earth as early as 2035, or as late as 2039, and with costs that range from $5.5 billion to $7.7 billion — a “far cry” from the original figure, Nelson said. “Pursuing two potential paths forward will ensure that NASA is able to bring these samples back from Mars with significant cost and schedule saving compared to the previous plan,” Nelson said. “These samples have the potential to change the way we understand Mars, our universe, and — ultimately — ourselves.” While both options are more streamlined than the original plan, they each contain similar architecture, which requires landing a Mars Ascent Vehicle on the Martian surface. That vehicle will be loaded with the samples collected by Perseverance, and then it will lift off, rendezvousing with the ESA’s Earth Return Orbiter in orbit around Mars. Then, the orbiter will head back to Earth and drop off the sample capsule, similar to how rocks and dust from the asteroid Bennu were delivered by the OSIRIS-REX mission, Fox said. There was no easy way to get rid of any single element of the original Mars Sample Return design, so the focus shifted to simplifying each piece, Fox said. For example, NASA opted for a direct return of the samples to Earth, rather than placing them in orbit around the moon, which would require another vehicle to go and fetch them, Nelson said. The biggest difference between each option will be the landing mechanism, Fox said. For both strategies, the platform that will land on Mars will carry a smaller version of the Mars Ascent Vehicle than previously planned, and the platform’s solar panels will be replaced with a system that can supply power and heat even during dust storms on Mars. This will enable the samples to be returned to Earth sooner, Fox said. “We are very confident that we can return all 30 samples before 2040 and for less than the $11 billion,” Fox said. Teams at JPL will focus on the engineering design for each plan at the same time over the next year, and one of the challenges will be making the sky crane 20% bigger than the one that landed Perseverance, Fox said. Another challenge is designing a Mars Ascent Vehicle that can survive landing on the red planet before launching from it. The European Space Agency is currently evaluating NASA’s new plans, according to NASA. Ultimately, President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration will be responsible for requesting an appropriate budget to support the program — and deciding whether they wish to continue with the program at all, Nelson added. Nelson said he has not discussed the new Mars sample return proposals with Jared Isaacman, the tech billionaire and spaceflight trailblazer Trump has picked to helm NASA, because all discussions are being handled by the transition team, he said. “But I think it was a responsible thing to do to not hand the new administration just one alternative if they want to have a Mars sample return, which I can’t imagine that they don’t,” Nelson said. Previously, China has declared an interest in also returning samples from Mars. The country’s Tianwen-3 mission might launch in 2028 to retrieve the Martian samples, which could be returned to Earth by 2031, although officials previously shared that they may also launch by 2030. “I don’t think we want the only sample return coming back on the Chinese spacecraft, and that’s just simply a grab and go kind of mission,” Nelson said. “Whereas ours has been a very methodical process … to find different samples of different layers showing different ages of material and rocks, and when we bring back those 30 samples, it’s going to give quite a history of what Mars was like millions of years ago when there was water in the lake. And the big question: Was there life millions of years ago?”"
Massive ‘space object’ fragment crashes into remote village in Kenya,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/02/science/kenya-space-object-intl-latam/index.html,"A huge, red-hot object fell from the sky into a Kenyan village on Monday afternoon according to local residents cited by the country’s national broadcaster, prompting an immediate investigation by the national space agency. The object has since been identified as a “fragment of a space object,” the Kenya Space Agency said in a statement Wednesday. The KSA said it has taken custody of the object that landed in the remote village of Mukuku, in the southern county of Makueni, describing it as apparent space junk measuring 2.5 meters (about 8 feet) wide and weighing 500 kg (about 1,100 pounds). “The Agency wishes to clarify that the object, a metallic ring measuring approximately 2.5 meters in diameter and weighing about 500 kg is a fragment of a space object,” the KSA said. Preliminary assessments suggest it is a separation ring from a rocket, the agency said, noting that space debris more typically falls into the ocean or burns up before entering Earth’s atmosphere. The fallen object is likely an isolated case and is still under investigation, it added. Julius Rotich, Mbooni Sub County Police Commander, told the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation that the object was still hot when officers arrived Monday, and that residents had to be cordoned off from the area until it cooled down. The broadcaster showed images of police tape wrapped around the ring, which had fallen into some trees and brush, as residents gathered around. The KSA is analyzing the object and working to confirm where exactly it came from, it said."
"How to watch the Quadrantids, one of the strongest meteor showers of the year",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/02/science/quadrantid-meteor-shower-january/index.html,"The new year kicks off with the peak of the Quadrantids, one of the strongest meteor showers of the year, according to NASA. But keep your eyes peeled because with a peak only lasting about six hours, as opposed to multiple days, the Quadrantids are also one of the quickest meteor showers to blaze across the night sky. Meteors are leftover pieces from broken asteroids and comet particles that spread out in dusty trails orbiting the sun. Each year, Earth passes through the debris trails, and pieces of dust and rock create colorful, fiery displays called meteor showers as they disintegrate in our planet’s atmosphere. The peak of the Quadrantids is so limited compared with most meteor showers because the shower only has a thin stream of particles and Earth passes through the densest concentration of those particles quickly at a perpendicular angle, according to NASA. Maximum meteor activity is expected to peak between 10 a.m. ET to 1 p.m. ET (15 to 18 Coordinated Universal Time) on January 3, which favors Alaska, Hawaii and far eastern Asia, said Bob Lunsford, fireball report coordinator for the American Meteor Society. The best time to spot the meteor shower will be during the hours before dawn, according to EarthSky. Sky-gazers on the east coast of North America may see up to 25 meteors streaking across the skies, while those on the west coast could see double that amount due to a later sunrise, Lunsford said. And if skies remain clear over western Alaska, viewers of the shower could witness an excess of 100 meteors per hour, he said. The waxing crescent moon, only 11% full, will set well before midnight, allowing unhampered viewing of the meteor shower, Lunsford said. While the Quadrantids don’t have long, persistent trains streaking behind them, they are capable of producing bright fireballs for a dramatic display. Fireballs are bright blasts of light and color associated with larger particles that linger longer than typical meteor streaks, according to NASA. The Quadrantids usually aren’t visible in the Southern Hemisphere because the shower’s radiant point, or the point at which the meteors appear to come from, doesn’t rise that high in its sky before dawn. If you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn’t full of bright city lights. If you’re able to find an area unaffected by light pollution, meteors could be visible every couple of minutes from late evening until dawn. Find an open area with a wide view of the sky. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up. And give your eyes about 20 to 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness — without looking at your phone — so the meteors will be easier to spot. If the meteor shower’s name seems unusual, it’s probably because the name doesn’t sound as if it’s related to a constellation. That’s because the Quadrantids’ namesake constellation no longer exists — at least, not as a recognized constellation. The constellation Quadrans Muralis, first observed and noted in 1795 between Boötes and Draco, is no longer included in the International Astronomical Union’s list of modern constellations because it’s considered obsolete and isn’t used as a landmark for celestial navigation anymore, according to EarthSky. The radiant point of the shower is a right angle between the Big Dipper and the bright star Arcturus, according to EarthSky. But the meteors will be visible in all parts of the sky, so it’s not necessary to look only in that direction. Like the Geminid meteor shower, the Quadrantids come from a mysterious asteroid or “rock comet,” rather than an icy comet, which is unusual. This particular asteroid is 2003 EH1, which takes 5.52 years to complete one orbit around the sun and measures 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) across. But astronomers believe a second object, Comet 96P/Machholz, may also contribute to the shower, according to EarthSky. The comet orbits the sun every 5.3 years. Scientists think a larger comet was gravitationally bound into a short orbit by the sun around 2000 BC. The comet left behind meteors for years before breaking apart sometime between the years 100 and 950. As a result, the comet left behind many celestial offspring known collectively as the Machholz Complex, which includes the Quadrantid meteor shower’s parent bodies Comet 96P/Machholz and asteroid 2003 EH1, as well as two different comet groups and eight meteor showers, according to EarthSky. After the Quadrantids, there is a bit of a lull in meteor shower activity, and the next one won’t occur until April. Here are the remaining showers to anticipate and their peak dates in 2025. Lyrids: April 21-22 Eta Aquariids: May 3-4 Southern Delta Aquariids: July 29-30 Alpha Capricornids: July 29-30 Perseids: August 12-13 Draconids: October 8-9 Orionids: October 22-23 Southern Taurids: November 3-4 Northern Taurids: November 8-9 Leonids: November 16-17 Geminids: December 12-13 Ursids: December 21-22"
"When to see ‘blood’ moons, eclipses and meteor showers in 2025",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/science/full-moons-eclipses-meteor-showers-2025/index.html,"With the arrival of a new year comes plenty of opportunities to witness a bevy of celestial events that will brighten the night sky. Each month, keep an eye out for a gleaming full moon, weather permitting, and there may even be chances to glimpse solar and lunar eclipses. What’s more, a multitude of bright annual meteor showers will return, so mark your calendars. The sun is also experiencing the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, called solar maximum, so there is always the promise of colorful auroras that may dance around Earth’s northern and southern poles (or in unexpected places) due to solar storms. Don’t forget to look out for different planets as they become visible in the night sky throughout the year, and maybe you’ll spot the International Space Station as it passes over your area. Here are some of the celestial sightings you can anticipate in 2025. Each month’s full moon is associated with a specific name, according to the Farmers’ Almanac. But the full moons have a variety of names and meanings according to different indigenous tribes. January 13: Wolf moon February 12: Snow moon March 14: Worm moon April 12: Pink moon May 12: Flower moon June 11: Strawberry moon July 10: Buck moon August 9: Sturgeon moon September 7: Corn moon October 6: Harvest moon November 5: Beaver moon December 4: Cold moon In 2025, there will be two partial solar eclipses. A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, but none of the celestial bodies is perfectly aligned, according to NASA. Unlike during a total solar eclipse, the moon only blocks part of the sun’s face, creating a crescent shape in which it appears the moon is taking a “bite” out of the sun. The first partial solar eclipse will happen on March 29, and it will be visible across parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and North and South America. The second partial solar eclipse will fall on September 21 and be visible over parts of Australia and Antarctica as well as some islands in the Pacific Ocean. There will also be two total lunar eclipses that occur during the March and September full moon events. A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when Earth is between the sun and moon and the three celestial objects line up in a row so that the moon passes into our planet’s shadow. When the moon is within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra, it takes on a reddish hue, which has led to the nickname “blood moon” for a lunar eclipse, according to NASA. That shadow isn’t perfect, so faint sunbeams sneak around the shadow’s edges on all sides in the colors of a sunset, bathing the moon in brilliant, warm hues. The first total lunar eclipse will be visible between March 13-14 and cross over Western Europe, parts of Asia, parts of Australia, western Africa, North and South America, and Antarctica. The second total lunar eclipse will occur on September 7-8 and be visible from Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of eastern South America, Alaska and Antarctica. Check Time and Date’s website to see when each of these eclipses will appear and the specific locations that will be able to view them. There will be ample chances throughout the year to see meteor showers unspoiled by the glare of the full moon. “2025 will be a better year for meteor observers,” said Bill Cooke, the lead for NASA’s Meteoroid Environments Office. The new year will kick off with the peak of the Quadrantid meteor shower, best seen in the early morning hours of January 3, according to Robert Lunsford, fireball report coordinator for the American Meteor Society. Here are the other meteor showers to anticipate in 2025 and their peak dates, according to the American Meteor Society and EarthSky. Lyrids: April 21-22 Eta Aquariids: May 3-4 Southern Delta Aquariids: July 29-30 Alpha Capricornids: July 29-30 Perseids: August 12-13 Draconids: October 8-9 Orionids: October 22-23 Southern Taurids: November 3-4 Northern Taurids: November 8-9 Leonids: November 16-17 Geminids: December 12-13 Ursids: December 21-22"
Silver amulet discovered in Germany could rewrite Christian history in Europe,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/20/science/silver-amulet-germany-christianity-scli-intl/index.html,"A small silver amulet discovered by archaeologists in Germany could transform our understanding of how Christianity spread under the Roman Empire, experts have said. The tiny artefact, which measures about 1.4 inches (3.6 centimeters) long, was unearthed in a 3rd-century Roman grave just outside Frankfurt back in 2018. Archaeologists discovered it on the skeleton of a man buried in a cemetery in the Roman city of Nida, one of the largest and most important sites in the central German state of Hesse. However, it has taken until now for researchers to be able to examine a thin silver foil that was found inside it. Alongside other artefacts in the grave, such as an incense burner and a jug made of clay, the amulet was found under the skeleton’s chin. Also known as a phylactery, it was probably worn on a ribbon around the man’s neck to provide spiritual protection. The “hair-thin” foil inside the amulet was so brittle that it would have simply disintegrated if researchers had tried to unfurl it. However, microscopic examinations and X-rays carried out back in 2019 showed that there were words engraved on it. It took a further five years before the team at the Archaeological Museum Frankfurt figured out a way to decipher what they said. The breakthrough came in May of this year, when researchers at the Leibniz Center for Archaeology in Mainz (LEIZA) used CT scanners to analyze the foil. Ivan Calandra, head of the imaging laboratory at LEIZA, explained the process in  a press statement. “The challenge in the analysis was that the silver sheet was rolled, but after around 1,800 years it was of course also creased and pressed. Using CT, we were able to scan it at a very high resolution and create a 3D model.” It was only through this process of digitally unrolling the sheet that the entire text became visible and could then be deciphered. What the researchers discovered astounded them. There on the foil were 18 lines of Latin text that repeatedly referenced Jesus, as well as St. Titus, a disciple and confidant of St. Paul the Apostle. As the grave in which the amulet was found dates back to somewhere between 230 and 270 AD, the amulet has emerged as the earliest evidence of Christianity in Europe north of the Alps. All previous discoveries are from at least 50 years after this, according to the statement. At the time of the burial, Christianity was becoming an increasingly popular sect but identifying as a Christian was still risky. Clearly the buried man, who is thought to have been aged 35 to 45, felt his faith so strongly that he took it to the grave with him. Markus Scholz, an archaeologist and expert in Latin inscriptions and professor at Frankfurt’s Goethe University, painstakingly deciphered the text of the “Frankfurt Silver Inscription,” as it is known. Describing the complicated process in the statement, he said: “Sometimes it took me weeks, even months, to come up with the next idea. I called in experts from the history of theology, among others, and bit by bit we worked together to approach the text and finally decipher it.” The fact that the writing was entirely in Latin was very unexpected, he said. “This is unusual for this period. Normally, such inscriptions on amulets were written in Greek or Hebrew.” When translated into English, the text reads: “(In the name?) of St Titus. Holy, holy, holy! In the name of Jesus Christ, Son of God! The Lord of the World Resists (to the best of his ability?) All attacks(?)/setbacks(?). The God(?) grants the well-being Entry. This means of salvation(?) protects The human being who Surrenders to the will Of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Since before Jesus Christ All knees bow to Jesus Christ: the heavenly The earthly and The subterranean and every tongue Confess (to Jesus Christ).” There is no reference in the text to any other faith besides Christianity, which would also have been unusual at this time. According to the Frankfurt archaeology museum, reliable evidence of Christian life in the northern Alpine regions of the Roman Empire only goes as far back as the 4th century AD. Wolfram Kinzig, a church historian and professor from the University of Bonn, helped Scholz to decipher the inscription. The “silver inscription is one of the oldest pieces of evidence we have for the spread of the New Testament in Roman Germania, because it quotes Philippians 2:10–11 in Latin translation,” Kinzig explained in an interview published on the University of Bonn’s website. “It’s a striking example of how Biblical quotations were used in magic designed to protect the dead,” said Kinzig. Peter Heather, a professor of medieval history at King’s College London with a specialist interest in the evolution of Christianity, described the discovery as a “fantastic find.” Heather, who wasn’t involved in the research, told CNN: “The capacity to be able to decipher the writing on that rolled-up piece of silver is extraordinary. This is something that’s only possible now with modern technology. If they’d found it 100 years ago they wouldn’t have known what it was. Silver amulets are probably going to contain some kind of magical scroll but you don’t know what – it could be any religion.” He added: “You’ve got evidence of Christian communities in more central parts of the empire but not in a frontier town like that in Roman Germany so that is very unusual, well it’s unique. You’re pushing the history of Christianity in that region back.”"
Scientists think they know why Stonehenge was rebuilt thousands of years ago,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/19/science/stonehenge-monument-early-farmers/index.html,"Scientists made a major discovery this year linked to Stonehenge — one of humanity’s biggest mysteries — and the revelations keep coming. A team of researchers shared evidence in August suggesting that the Altar Stone, an iconic monolith at the heart of Stonehenge, was transported hundreds of miles to the site in southern England nearly 5,000 years ago from what’s now northeastern Scotland. Just a month later, a report led by the same experts ruled out the possibility that the stone came from Orkney, an archipelago off Scotland’s northeastern coast that’s home to Neolithic sites from that time frame, and the search for the monolith’s point of origin continues. Now, research building on the two previous studies suggests that Stonehenge may have been reconstructed in England around 2620 to 2480 BC to help unify ancient Britons as newcomers arrived from Europe. The new study, published Thursday in the journal Archaeology International, also reveals how Neolithic people may have moved the 13,227-pound (6-metric-ton) block over 435 miles (700 kilometers) from where it originated. Similarities between stone circles in Scotland and Stonehenge, located in Wiltshire on the southern edge of England’s Salisbury Plain, add to a growing collection of clues showing there was likely more connectivity between ancient societies in these two distant areas than once thought, according to the study. Together, the findings from the new study and those published earlier this year are shedding light on the purpose of Stonehenge and the arrangement of its monoliths, an enduring enigma since excavations began at the site in the 17th century. “These new insights have significantly expanded our understanding as to what the original purpose of Stonehenge might have been,” said lead study author Mike Parker Pearson, professor of British later prehistory at the University College London’s Institute of Archaeology, in an email. “It shows that this site on Sailsbury Plain was important to the people not just living nearby, but across Britain, so much so that they brought massive monoliths across sometimes hundreds of miles to this one location.” Construction on Stonehenge began as early as 3000 BC and occurred over several phases in an area first inhabited as early as 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, according to the researchers. Previous analysis has shown that bluestones, a type of fine-grained sandstone, and larger silicified sandstone blocks called sarsens were used in the monument’s construction. The bluestones were brought from 140 miles (225 kilometers) away at the Preseli Hills area in west Wales and are thought to have been the first stones placed at the site. The sarsens, used later, came from the West Woods near Marlborough, located about 15 miles (25 kilometers) away. Researchers believe the Altar Stone was placed within the central horseshoe during a rebuilding phase. While the exact date is unknown, the study authors believe the stone arrived between 2500 and 2020 BC. It’s during that rebuilding phase, according to the research, that Stonehenge’s builders erected the large sarsen stones to form an outer circle and an inner horseshoe made of trilithons, or paired upright stones connected by horizontal stone beams, which remain part of the monument to this day. The Altar Stone is the largest of the bluestones used to build Stonehenge. Today, the Altar Stone lies recumbent at the foot of the largest trilithon and is barely visible peeking through the grass. Many questions remain about the exact purpose for Stonehenge and the Altar Stone. But the monument aligns with the sun during the winter and summer solstices. “There’s good evidence to suggest that these large stone monoliths have ancestral significance, representing and even embodying the ancestors of the people who placed them,” Parker Pearson said. “(The Altar Stone’s) location within Stonehenge is important as if you stand at the center of the stone circle, the midwinter solstice sun sets over its middle.” During the winter, Neolithic people would gather near Stonehenge at the village of Durrington Walls, bringing pigs and cattle with them for a feast, Parker Pearson said. Stonehenge was also the largest burial ground of its time, lending support to the idea that the site may have been used as a religious temple, a solar calendar and an ancient observatory all in one. And nearly half the Neolithic people buried near Stonehenge came from somewhere other than Salisbury Plain. The new research adds a political twist to the backstory of a rebuilt Stonehenge. “The fact that all of its stones originated from distant regions, making it unique among over 900 stone circles in Britain, suggests that the stone circle may have had a political as well as a religious purpose — as a monument of unification for the peoples of Britain, celebrating their eternal links with their ancestors and the cosmos,” Parker Pearson said. This show of unity — transporting giant stones long distances — would not have been easy for Neolithic people. The study authors don’t think boats at the time would have been strong enough to carry anything like the Altar Stone across coastal waters. “Though the wheel had been invented elsewhere, it hadn’t quite reached Britain yet, so the massive stone blocks would likely have had to be dragged by wooden sledge sliding atop wooden rails that could be continuously lifted and re-laid,” Parker Pearson said. The wooden sledge could have had shock absorbers made from vegetation to cushion the stone, which would have been susceptible to cracking on the long journey, the study authors said. Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of people would have been needed to help move the stone over land, and the journey may have taken about eight months, the researchers noted in the paper. “Travel by land would have provided much better opportunities for spectacle, pageantry, feasting and celebration that would have drawn people in (the) thousands to witness and take part in this extraordinary venture,” according to the study. Moving the massive stone from Scotland to southern England suggests there was a network between two distant groups fostered by collaboration and cooperation — something the researchers think existed due to striking cultural similarities in both locations. “They would have taken significant coordination across Britain — people were literally pulling together — in a time before telephones and email to organize such an effort,” Parker Pearson said. The Altar Stone is similar in both size and placement to other large horizontal blocks in stone circles found in northeast Scotland, the study authors said. These recumbent stone circles have only been found in that part of Scotland, rather than the rest of England, which suggests that the Altar Stone may have been a gift from the community in northern Scotland to signify a type of alliance. “Moreover, if you look at the layouts of some of the houses at Durrington Walls near Stonehenge, there’s a striking similarity in their architecture to those found far north in the Orkney Islands, but rarely anywhere in between,” Parker Pearson said. “We’ve also known for some time that people shared a style of pottery — which we call Grooved Ware — across the entire island of Britain. It seems to have been one of several innovations that were developed in Scotland and spread south from 3000 BC onwards.” As an island, Britain’s population has changed multiple times. The region’s early farmers descended from people from the Middle East who arrived on the island about 6,000 years ago, bringing agricultural practices with them. The newcomers replaced hunter-gatherer communities that had inhabited Britain previously and formed the majority of the population from 4000 to 2500 BC, Parker Pearson said. But around 2500 BC, people began to arrive in Britain from Europe, largely from what’s now known as Germany and the Netherlands, and it’s around this time when Stonehenge was rebuilt, according to the study. The researchers believe that the rebuilding process was “a response to a legitimation crisis brought on by this influx of new people” and an attempt to unite the Neolithic farmer population. The European arrivals, called the Beaker people for the distinctive pottery that they buried with their dead, brought technology such as the wheel and metalworking with them. “Within 16 generations over 400 years it seems that most people had ancestries that were a mix of the two, yet this was a mix of 90% incomer to 10% indigenous farmer,” Parker Pearson said. “The genetic makeup of Britain’s population almost completely changed over half a millennium.” Eventually, the Beaker people’s descendants replaced Neolithic farmers and became Britain’s dominant population. So ultimately, Stonehenge, which brought “together these extraordinary and alien rocks which (symbolized) and embodied far and distant communities within a complex material and monumental expression of unity between people, land, ancestors and the heavens,” failed to unify the same communities which built it, the study authors noted. “The findings of this study shed most unexpected and highly impressive new light on the history of Stonehenge – a remarkable achievement considering how well-studied this famous site has been,” said Duncan Garrow, a professor in the department of archaeology at the University of Reading specializing in European prehistory. Garrow was not involved in the new study. Now, the researchers are redoubling their efforts to determine where exactly in northeast Scotland the Altar Stone originated, said Richard Bevins, coauthor of the new study, as well as the previous studies this year concerning the Altar Stone. Bevins is an honorary professor in the department of geography and Earth sciences at the UK’s Aberystwyth University. “It’s really gratifying that our geological investigations can contribute to the archaeological research and the unfolding story as our knowledge has been improving so dramatically in just the last few years,” Bevins said. “Our research is like forensic science. We are a small team of (Earth) scientists, each bringing their own area of expertise; it is this combination of skills that has allowed us to identify the sources of the bluestones, and now the Altar Stone.”"
Cannons abandoned by doomed Spanish expedition are thought to be oldest firearms found in US,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/18/science/oldest-firearm-cannon-scli-intl/index.html,"Archaeologists working in Arizona have discovered what appear to be the oldest firearms ever found in the continental United States: two cannons abandoned by a Spanish expeditionary force that was attacked by Native Americans. The 42-inch-long (107-centimeter) bronze cannons, also known as wall guns, were found by independent researcher Deni Seymour. They are the first firearms recovered from an expedition led by Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, which traveled north from what is now Mexico to the American Southwest between 1539 and 1542. In a paper published in the International Journal of Historical Archaeology last month, Seymour detailed how the first cannon, which was found in 2020, was discovered on the floor of a stone and adobe structure that was part of a small town built by the Spanish and abandoned following the battle in 1541. Previous discoveries of associated artifacts, as well as analysis of charcoal and a piece of pottery found on the floor of the structure, had established a link between the site, known to archaeologists as San Geronimo III, and the Coronado expedition. “This cannon and the battle that occurred around it are significant in that they represent the earliest successful Native American uprising in the Continental US, since the Spaniards did not come back for 150 years,” instead retreating to what is now Mexico, Seymour told CNN on Tuesday. Although these cannons would have been deadly, they were slow to load and reload, Seymour told CNN. Investigations revealed that the first cannon had not been fired, which suggests the occupants of the structure were surprised by the attackers and didn’t have time to load it, Seymour said. “They were probably overwhelmed by the attacking force and likely were engaged in hand-to-hand combat from their bedsides,” she said. “It took some time to load and fire the cannon, as it would have for matchlock guns so they would have been of no use in a surprise attack.” The second cannon was found on the battlefield itself and had been fired by the Spanish defenders. “I suspect that the area of the site where that cannon was stored was not overwhelmed by the attackers as fully,” said Seymour. “It appears that the defenders had time to mount a defense, which would have involved reigniting the fire or at least exposing coals so the match for the gun could be lit, loading the gun, and hauling it downslope, positioning it, and then firing.” The discoveries shed new light on the O’odham Native Americans, who lived in what is now Arizona and the northern Mexican state of Sonora, she added. “This means that rather than being docile and peaceful as their later colonial period reputation has indicated, they were exceptional warriors and stood up for their own and their land at a critical time, much earlier than even other native groups in the area,” Seymour said. Next, Seymour hopes to find the rest of the trail traveled by Coronado’s expedition, and to document 12 known sites along the Arizona portion of the trail."
"Grisly remains point to a bleak, ancient chapter in British history",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/16/science/bronze-age-britain-massacre/index.html,"Thousands of ancient butchered human bones found in a deep shaft in southwest England have pointed archaeologists to a grim chapter of British prehistory that occurred during the Early Bronze Age. Analysis of the more than 3,000 bones has suggested that unidentified assailants violently killed at least 37 men, women and children before butchering and cannibalizing their victims between 2210 and 2010 BC at a site called Charterhouse Warren, which is located in Somerset. Then, the attackers tossed the remnants of the bodies down a 49.2-foot (15-meter) natural shaft linked to a cave system. The grisly find represents the largest example of interpersonal violence from this period in Britain, according to the authors of a study describing the findings, which published Sunday in the journal Antiquity. The bones are rare, direct evidence that point to a cycle of violence at a time during the Early Bronze Age that experts had once considered to be largely peaceful in Britain. Most of the hundreds of human skeletons recovered from 2500 to 1500 BC in the country typically have not contained evidence of brutality, the study authors said. “We actually find more evidence for injuries to skeletons dating to the Neolithic period (10,000 BC to 2,200 BC) in Britain than the Early Bronze Age, so Charterhouse Warren stands out as something very unusual,” said lead study author Rick Schulting, professor of scientific and prehistoric archaeology at the University of Oxford, in a statement.“It paints a considerably darker picture of the period than many would have expected.” The researchers believe the intent behind the extreme treatment of the victims’ remains was to dehumanize them as revenge after some perceived grievous offense. But trying to determine the exact motive from unknown attackers during a time before written documents existed in the region is proving difficult. Excavations took place at the Charterhouse Warren shaft, which is part of a limestone plateau, in the 1970s and 1980s as part of an effort to better understand the subterranean cave system. There, researchers unearthed piles of buried human bones, mixed in with cattle bones, that told the story of mass violence striking an ancient community. Multiple studies have covered the site and its contents since their discovery. But the find drew Schulting’s attention in 2016 thanks to his colleague and study coauthor Dr. Louise Loe, head of Oxford Archaeology’s Heritage Burial Services, who excavates and analyzes human skeletons from archaeological sites. Loe had studied the remains and knew Schulting was interested in documenting evidence of prehistoric violence. “We examined some of the material together and it quickly became clear that the extent of modifications to the bones were far beyond what either of us had ever seen,” Schulting said. “So the project developed to tell the story of the site.” An analysis of the bones revealed that many of the skulls showed fatal impacts from blunt force trauma, but the violence didn’t end there. Numerous cutmarks covering the bones and fractures at or near the time of death showed that the victims’ heads, arms, feet and legs had been removed from their bodies using stone tools. There was also evidence to show that their scalps and skin had been removed, as well as some heads with removed lower jaws and potentially tongues. “In addition, a small number of small bones of the hands and feet exhibit fresh bone crushing fractures that are consistent with the flat molars of omnivores, including humans, rather than the sharper punctures caused by carnivores,” the authors wrote in the study, noting that the body parts were buried quickly after being butchered and cannibalized, making scavenging by animals highly unlikely. The bone analysis also showed that almost all of the victims were local to the area, suggesting that the attackers invaded the community to carry out their brutal acts. What’s more, the extreme manner in which the remains were handled is beyond what Schulting and his colleagues have seen from remains of ancient animals who were butchered. “The most surprising thing is the sheer extent of the butchery of the bodies,” Schulting said. “They were killed with blows to the head, and then systematically dismembered, defleshed, bones smashed apart.” The researchers believe the bones are all from a single event. But given that there are different layers of material found within the shaft, the animal and human remains within it may have been deposited “over decades and up to a century or so is possible,” according to the study. “The location itself may be the common denominator; the natural shaft and large underlying cave system inviting comparisons with a portal to the underworld,” the study authors wrote. But the biggest question is why this community was brutalized in the first place. In order to glean the reasons, the team looked back over time for similar violent events. For context, the researchers looked to the nearby Paleolithic site of Gough’s Cave in Cheddar Gorge, just 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) to the west. There, prior excavations revealed six individuals whose bones had been dismembered and butchered, including potential human chew marks on hand, foot and rib bones. But there is no evidence that the people who cannibalized them actually killed their victims, implying that the cannibalism was actually a form of funerary ritual, the study authors said. Researchers have found evidence of warfare carried out with bows and arrows at Bronze Age sites, and evidence exists from the Early Neolithic about 1,500 years before Charterhouse when weapons like swords began to appear in the historical record, Schulting said. But the Charterhouse Warren victims showed no signs of putting up a fight, suggesting a substantial part of a community was caught off guard or held captive and massacred, and that how they were dealt with afterward was far different from ritual. There are a few limited examples of victims of violence being buried, like a young male found in a ditch at Stonehenge who was shot multiple times with arrows, according to the study authors. But funeral rituals largely included cremation or burials of multiple individuals together, rather than what was found at Charterhouse Warren. The researchers don’t believe the people were killed as food due to starvation, given the abundant amount of cattle bones found mixed in with the human bones. Instead, the study authors believe cannibalism may have been an extreme form of dehumanizing the victims by “othering” the deceased, or eating their flesh and mixing their bones with cattle bones as a way to liken the victims to animals, the researchers said. Innovations in weaponry, like daggers, suggest that interpersonal violence was occurring at the time in Early Bronze Age Britain, said Barry Molloy, an associate professor in the school of archaeology at University College Dublin. Enemies could be considered “others, people so distant from your group that extreme violence against them became acceptable,” said Molloy, who was not involved in the study. Population turnovers in Britain within the centuries surrounding the event suggest exceptional othering was happening as new groups took over parts of Britain, Molloy said. “How far people in prehistoric Europe were willing to dehumanise and brutalise the othered enemy group is writ large at (Charterhouse Warren),” he said. But what could have necessitated such a dramatic act? The study authors don’t believe the attackers were fighting for control of resources at the site, and climate change didn’t seem to have an impact on conflict in Britain at the time. While it’s impossible to know the ancestry of the attackers, there is no evidence to suggest a clash of communities with different ancestries or ethnicities. Understanding motivations in prehistory before written records existed in Britain is incredibly challenging, Schulting said. But the sheer number of victims means there must have been an even larger number of aggressors, he said. Analysis of DNA from the bones is in progress to determine how closely related the victims were, and the research team also intends to study the animal bones going forward, Schulting said. And there is evidence within the teeth of two of the child victims that they had the plague, based on previous research, although it’s unclear how it may have been linked to the violent episode. “Possibly this was seen as revenge for some transgression,” Schulting said. “Such violent acts can emerge in a climate of anger and fear — there is evidence that some individuals had the plague, which may have contributed to a sense of fear and uncertainty. Tensions may have built up from relatively innocuous beginnings (theft, accusations of witchcraft, and so on) and then escalated out of control.” Molloy said that while the theory of a single massacre is compelling, it’s more chilling to think that this phenomenon took place across multiple instances, possibly normalizing cannibalism. “Sometimes a single site can radically change our perceptions, and I think that Charterhouse has the potential to do just that,” Schulting said. “The extreme violence seen here is unlikely to have been an isolated incident. There would have been repercussions, as the relatives and friends of the victims sought revenge, and this could have led to cycles of violence in the region.”"
"Orca mom is carrying a dead calf for the second time, raising concerns among scientists",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/science/orca-carrying-dead-calf-tahlequah/index.html,"Tahlequah, the mother orca denoted as J35 who captured hearts worldwide in 2018 by carrying her dead calf for 17 days and over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), is once again displaying a similar act of mourning. Her newest calf, a female known as J61 to researchers, was first spotted on December 20 in the Puget Sound area on Washington state’s northwest coast by members of the public. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration later confirmed the sighting on December 23, according to Dr. Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research. Tragically, by New Year’s Eve, the calf was confirmed dead, he said. Researchers have reported as of January 5 that Tahlequah is still carrying the calf, said Dr. Brad Hanson, a wildlife biologist with the Northwest Fisheries Science Center of NOAA. Updates regarding the mother’s activity with J61 may become limited as her family group, or pod, departs from its main Puget Sound base. Tahlequah is constantly nudging the deceased calf’s body, which weighs around 300 pounds (136 kilograms), with her snout to keep it close and prevent the ocean from pulling the carcass away. “As with last time, I think it’s enough to recognize how strong the mother-calf bond is in killer whales (among the strongest social relationships in any animal), and to see that she is clearly not ready to let go,” Weiss, whose doctoral research focused on orca social structure, said via email. ﻿The loss of a calf is not only devastating to Tahlequah but for the rapidly declining population of Southern Resident orcas, which is teetering on the brink of extinction with only 73 of the marine mammals remaining as of 2019. The Southern Resident population is noted as “one of the most critically endangered populations of marine mammals” in the United States, according to researchers. This act of grief raises concerns among researchers, including Weiss and Hanson, for its physical and emotional toll on Tahlequah as a member of the highly vulnerable Southern Resident population. Carrying the extra weight of the calf’s body is both weighing down the mother and slowing her movements, which could impact her ability to forage for food. However, Weiss noted that during the orca’s previous 17-day display of grief, there was no visible decline in her condition, which could signal that other members of her pod were helping her receive her food supply. While some female killer whales have been known to grieve the loss of their calves in ways similar to Tahlequah, the distance and time that she carried her newborn in 2018 made her an exception. Her current behavior, mirroring her past actions, is also unusual, according to Weiss. Tahlequah is known to be the mother of another orca, J47, who is now around 14 years old, and also J57, a baby born two years after her 2018 loss. Killer whales typically reproduce every five years, giving the mother time to recover from the physical demands of pregnancy and giving birth, Hanson said. While no significant data are available to suggest why Tahlequah may have lost two calves within her lifetime, orca pregnancies are fraught with challenges. Nearly 70% of pregnancies in the Southern Resident orca population, which Tahlequah and her offspring belong to, result in spontaneous abortions or very early deaths, Weiss said. Unsuccessful pregnancies and struggles for survival within exclusively fish-eating killer whale communities in the northeast Pacific Ocean can be attributed to challenges from pollutants, noise, inbreeding and a lack of Chinook salmon, which is their primary food source, Weiss said. The loss of a female calf like J61 is particularly harmful to the species’ future because it diminishes the population’s ability for reproduction. “Assuming (orcas) live a full lifespan, you’re looking at them producing five to six calves under ideal conditions, and part of the problem is that most of the females in this population have not produced that many viable calves,” Hanson said."
"The comb jelly, one of the oldest animals on Earth, can fuse with another",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/30/science/comb-jellies-fuse-single-organism/index.html,"Late one summer night in 2023, Kei Jokura entered the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, excitedly carrying a blob in a beaker. The biologist had just come from the first floor, where tanks held a colony of gelatinous comb jellies. The blob was bigger than others, and it looked as though two of the jellies had merged into one. “I couldn’t believe my eyes at first,” recalled Jokura, who was then a postdoctoral researcher at the UK’s University of Exeter. Mariana Rodriguez-Santiago, a postdoctoral researcher at Colorado State University, was working on her own project when Jokura appeared. “We were all amazed and astonished, thinking, ‘How can they fuse and still be swimming and moving around like a unit?’” she said. She grabbed a pipette and gently poked one of the jellies. It squirmed. Simultaneously, so did the one to which it seemed to be attached. “We thought, ‘Are they able to feel the same thing? Are they one individual? Two individuals? How can we disentangle this?’” she recalled. Over the next few weeks, Rodriguez-Santiago helped Jokura combine multiple pairs of the comb jellies, scientifically known as Mnemiopsis leidyi, to see what happened. The findings of the investigation led by Jokura, published October 7 in the journal Current Biology, showed that not only could two jellies fuse their bodies, but their nervous and digestive systems fused as well. Two effectively became one. “The fusion phenomenon has definitely brought up many interesting questions, such as which genes are involved in fusion, what happens to neural signaling, and what defines ‘self’ and ‘nonself,’” said Jokura, now a postdoctoral researcher at Japan’s National Institute for Basic Biology. “Each of these themes has the potential to challenge our fundamental understanding of biology.” Comb jellies are found all around the world in coastal waters and the deep ocean. Though they look similar to jellyfish, they don’t sting and belong to a different phylum, Ctenophora, which is Greek for “comb-bearers.” They are named for their combs, rows of hairlike appendages called cilia they use to move through the water. Ctenophores are one of, if not the, oldest animals on Earth — quite possibly a sister to all other animals in the tree of life, so “they provide a really unique opportunity to study fundamental aspects of nervous system function,” said Rodriguez-Santiago, coauthor of the study. “They belong to a group of animals which were there when the very first animals evolved,” said Pawel Burkhardt, an evolutionary biologist and researcher at the University of Bergen in Norway. Burkhardt was coauthor of another October report on M. leidyi, published in the journal PNAS, showing that the jelly is able to develop backward, reverting to an earlier life stage following stress. He was not involved in the study that appeared in Current Biology. “The two recent papers highlight that ctenophores have the opportunity to adapt quickly to changing environments and that their developmental programs are potentially more flexible than seen in other animals,” he said. It also may be, Jokura’s paper suggests, that ctenophores lack the protective allorecognition mechanism that allows one organism to tell the difference between its own cells and tissues and those of another organism. In humans, for example, allorecognition underpins the organ rejection that happens in transplant surgeries. Jokura was studying how M. leidyi responds to light when he discovered two injured specimens had become conjoined. Curious to recreate the phenomenon, he and Rodriguez-Santiago began experimenting. They sliced off parts of several jellies and placed excised pairs together in petri dishes overnight. Nine out of 10 pairs fused successfully, resulting in animals with two sensory organs and two sets of anal openings, whereas typical jellies have only one of each. As it turned out, the fusion happened much more quickly than the researchers expected, according to Jokura. “To observe the fusion process — when and how it happens — we performed time-lapse imaging,” he said. The research team placed cut jellies near each other and waited. At first, the jellies continued to contract their muscles independently. Within an hour, their rhythmic movements started to synchronize. By the two-hour mark, they were in sync. When poked gently on one side, both sides of the combined organism contracted in unison. Imaging demonstrated another layer to the fusion: The animals’ digestive systems also combined. The researchers fed a fluorescently labeled brine shrimp into one mouth of a pair of jellies that had been fused for two days. Then the team traced the meal’s movement through a microscope. The digested particles traveled down the digestive canal, crossed the fusion boundary and entered into the digestive tract of the other animal — “and the other individual could poop out the food,” Rodriguez-Santiago explained. Eventually, the waste was expelled by both anuses, each in its own time. What Rodriguez-Santiago finds most interesting about the study is the way it calls into question what she thought of as “pretty hard boundaries” between self and other. Allorecognition is considered a protective adaptation because it enables a body to reject foreign cells that could introduce dangerous diseases. But these animals “bypass that sensory rejection to then potentially have an even better chance of survival,” she said. Burkhardt believes the findings may lead scientists toward an understanding of when animals evolved allorecognition and how simple nervous systems form and process information. Jokura wants to study further how the jellies’ nervous systems mesh following fusion. “I would like to investigate how their ‘thoughts’ are integrated,” he said. “By visualizing neural networks, we might be able to explore something like the fusion of consciousness.”"
‘Mystery volcano’ that erupted and cooled Earth in 1831 has finally been identified,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/03/science/mystery-volcano-1831-eruption-simushir/index.html,"An unknown volcano erupted so explosively in 1831 that it cooled Earth’s climate. Now, nearly 200 years later, scientists have identified the “mystery volcano.” The eruption was one of the most powerful of the 19th century, spewing so much sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere that annual average temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere dropped by about one 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit). The event took place during the last gasp of the Little Ice Age, one of the coldest periods on Earth in the past 10,000 years. While the year of this historic eruption was known, the volcano’s location was not. Researchers recently solved that puzzle by sampling ice cores in Greenland, peering back in time through the cores’ layers to examine sulfur isotopes, grains of ash and tiny volcanic glass shards deposited between 1831 and 1834. Using geochemistry, radioactive dating and computer modeling to map particles’ trajectories, the scientists linked the 1831 eruption to an island volcano in the northwest Pacific Ocean, they reported Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. According to the analysis, the mystery volcano was Zavaritskii (also spelled Zavaritsky) on Simushir Island, part of the Kuril Islands archipelago, an area disputed by Russia and Japan. Before the scientists’ findings, Zavaritskii’s last known eruption was in 800 BC. “For many of Earth’s volcanoes, particularly those in remote areas, we have a very poor understanding of their eruptive history,” said lead study author Dr. William Hutchison, a principal research fellow in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of St. Andrews in the United Kingdom. “Zavaritskii is located on an extremely remote island between Japan and Russia. No one lives there and historical records are limited to a handful of diaries from ships that passed these islands every few years,” Hutchison told CNN in an email. With little information available about Zavaritskii’s activity during the 19th century, no one previously suspected that it could be a candidate for the 1831 eruption. Instead, researchers considered volcanoes that were closer to the equator, such as the Babuyan Claro volcano in the Philippines, according to the study. “This eruption had global climatic impacts but was wrongly attributed to a tropical volcano for a long time period,” said Dr. Stefan Brönnimann, unit leader in climatology at the University of Bern in Switzerland. “The research now shows that the eruption took place on the Kurils, not in the tropics,” said Brönnimann, who was not involved in the study. Examination of the Greenland ice cores revealed that in 1831, sulfur fallout — a sign of volcanic activity — was about 6 ½ times greater in Greenland than it was in Antarctica. This finding suggested that the source was a major eruption from a midlatitude volcano in the Northern Hemisphere, the researchers reported. The study team also chemically analyzed ash and shards of volcanic glass measuring no more than 0.0008 inch (0.02 millimeter) long. When the scientists compared their results with geochemical datasets from volcanic regions, the closest matches were in Japan and the Kuril Islands. Volcanic eruptions in 19th century Japan were well-documented, and there were no records of a large eruption in 1831. But colleagues who had previously visited volcanoes in the Kuril Islands provided samples that led the researchers to a geochemical match with the Zavaritskii caldera. “The moment in the lab analysing the two ashes together — one from the volcano and one from the ice core — was a genuine eureka moment,” Hutchison said in his email. Radiocarbon dating of tephra, or volcanic ash, deposits on Simushir Island placed them within the past 300 years. What’s more, analysis of the caldera’s volume and sulfur isotopes suggested the crater formed after a massive eruption between 1700 and 1900, making Zavaritskii “the prime candidate” for the mystery eruption in 1831, the authors wrote. “I am still surprised that an eruption of this size went unreported,” Hutchison added. “Perhaps there are reports of ash fall or atmospheric phenomena occurring in 1831 that reside in a dusty corner of a library in Russia or Japan. The follow-up work to delve into these records really excites me.” Along with Zavaritskii, three other volcanoes blew their tops between 1808 and 1835. They marked the waning of the Little Ice Age, a climate anomaly that lasted from the early 1400s to around 1850. During this time, annual temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere dropped by 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) on average. In some places, temperatures were 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) cooler than normal, and the cooling persisted for decades. Two of the four eruptions were previously identified: Mount Tambora in Indonesia exploded in 1815, and Cosegüina erupted in Nicaragua in 1835. The volcano that produced the 1808/1809 eruption remains unknown. The addition of Zavaritskii highlights the potential of volcanoes in the Kuril Islands for disrupting Earth’s climate, the study authors reported. After the 1831 eruption, cooler and drier conditions emerged in the Northern Hemisphere. Reports of widespread hunger and hardship swiftly followed, with famines sweeping across India, Japan and Europe, affecting millions of people. “It seems plausible that volcanic climate cooling led to crop failure and famine,” Hutchison said. “A focus of ongoing research is to understand to what extent these famines were caused by volcano climate cooling, or by other socio-political factors.” By providing a long-missing piece of information about the 19th century volcanoes that cooled Earth’s climate, “the study perhaps strengthens our confidence on the role of volcanic eruptions for the last phase of the Little Ice Age,” Brönnimann said. Like Zavaritskii, many volcanoes worldwide are in isolated places and are poorly monitored, making it challenging to predict when and where the next large-magnitude eruption may strike, Hutchison added. If there’s a lesson to be learned from the 1831 eruption, it’s that volcanic activity in remote spots can have devastating global consequences — which people may be unprepared to face. “We don’t really have a coordinated international community to kick into gear when the next big one happens,” Hutchison said. “That is something we need to think about as both scientists and as (a) society.”"
Scientists have identified an estimated 10% of all species on Earth. Here’s what they found in 2024,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/31/science/new-species-named-in-2024/index.html,"A toothy toadstool. A vegetarian piranha with a distinctive mark. And a pygmy pipehorse floating in the Indian Ocean shallows. These wild wonders were among the hundreds of previously unknown species of animals, plants and fungi that scientists named and described for the first time in 2024, expanding our surprisingly limited knowledge of Earth’s diversity. “Scientists estimate that we’ve identified only one-tenth of all species on Earth,” said Dr.Shannon Bennett, chief of science at the California Academy of Sciences, in a statement. “While it is critical to place protections on known threatened species, we must also allocate resources towards identifying unknown species that may be just as important to the functioning of an ecosystem,” Bennett said. Researchers connected to the institution described 138 new species in 2024, including 32 fish. One standout was a pygmy pipehorse named Cylix nkosi. The seahorse relative was originally found in 2021 in the cool temperate waters surrounding the North Island of New Zealand, but the species described this year was discovered in the subtropical waters off South Africa, expanding the known range of this group to the Indian Ocean “South African reefs present notoriously difficult diving conditions with rough weather and intense, choppy waves — we knew we only had one dive to find it,” underwater photographer and marine biologist Richard Smith said in a statement. “This species is also quite cryptic, about the size of a golf tee, but luckily we spotted a female camouflaged against some sponges about a mile offshore on the sandy ocean floor.” The researchers involved in describing the new species chose nkosi as its name. A reference to the local Zulu word for “chief,” the name reflects the species’ crown-like head shape and acknowledges South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province where it was found. The Natural History Museum in London said its researchers had been involved in 190 new discoveries of living and fossilized animals, including 11 new species of moth, eight crabs, four rats and four snakes. One of the moth species from a genus called Hemiceratoides from Madagascar feeds itself by drinking the tears of sleeping birds, while another newly identified species of moth, Carmenta brachyclado, was found fluttering against a window in a Welsh living room despite its origins in Guyana. The moth got stuck in a boot belonging to a photographer, who unwittingly brought the insect from South America to her home in Wales, where it emerged. Her daughter, ecologist Daisy Cadet, recognized the creature as something unusual and contacted the Natural History Museum in London. Another striking find was a vegetarian piranha called Myloplus sauron from Brazil’s Xingu River, said Rupert Collins, a senior curator of fishes at the museum, who helped describe the fish. It was named sauron due to its resemblance to the Eye of Sauron from J.R.R.Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings.” “The reason we named it this was really a no-brainer because this fish is disc-shaped and has a thin vertical bar across the body, which looks just like an eye,” Collins said in a video shared by the museum. In addition, in 2024 scientists have documented a mystery mollusk in the deep ocean, a ghost shark, a blob-headed fish, and a type of semi-aquatic mouse. Among the fascinating finds from scientists at the UK’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew was an intriguing new species of fungi in wooded heathland near the town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, England. Phellodon castaneoleucus sports teeth-like structures instead of the gills usually seen beneath mushroom caps. Botanists also discovered five new orchid species from sites across the Indonesian archipelago, a gray-stemmed ghost palm from western Borneo with leaves with white undersides, and an enigmatic family of plants known as Afrothismia that are confined to continental African forests without the ability to photosynthesize. Scientists linked to Kew described 149 new species of plant and 23 species of fungi. The institute said that its annual list of new species is a reminder of the many unknowns waiting to be discovered. No doubt 2025 will bring a fresh list of newly discovered creatures, plants and fungi. “The sheer privilege of describing a species as new to science is a thrill that not many will ever get to experience,” said Martin Cheek, a senior research leader in the Africa team at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. “Sadly, this delight is increasingly being overshadowed by the many threats that plants face as a direct consequence of human activity,” he said. “The devastating reality is that more often than not, new species are being found on the brink of extinction and it’s a race against time to find and describe them all.”"
Ancient saber-toothed predator found in Spain is the oldest of its kind,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/19/science/gorgonopsian-fossil-mallorca-saber-tooth/index.html,"Before dinosaurs walked the Earth and tens of millions of years before the first mammals appeared, distant mammal relatives with long, serrated canine teeth were the dominant carnivores on land. Called gorgonopsians, the earliest animals in this lineage have long been missing from the fossil record. But the discovery of a newly identified gorgonopsian — the oldest saber-toothed animal ever found — is filling a longstanding blank space in the group’s history. These slender predators are known mostly from bones that are less than 270 million years old, but the recent fossil find is thought to be an unprecedented 280 million to 270 million years old. The newfound gorgonopsian adds to one of the earliest branches of the therapsid family tree — the Therapsida order includes not only gorgonopsians but also the ancestors of modern mammals and other nonmammalian groups that are now extinct. The finding is a notable puzzle piece that could help shed light on the earliest forebears of mammals, experts said. Gorgonopsians vanished around 252 million years ago, and their lineage died with them. All gorgonopsians had daggerlike canine teeth, and species ranged widely in size. Some were as small as cats, while others were as big as polar bears. Fossils of the newly described gorgonopsian included its knifelike canines; parts of its jaw; some vertebrae, ribs, tailbones and toe bones; and most of the bones from a hind limb, researchers reported Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The specimen’s blunt-snouted skull was incomplete but is estimated to measure about 7 inches (18 centimeters) long, and the animal would have been as tall as a medium-size dog and weighed roughly 66 to 88 pounds (30 to 40 kilograms), according to study coauthor Ken Angielczyk, MacArthur Curator of Paleomammalogy at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History. Other than being four-legged and having a long tail, the gorgonopsian wouldn’t have looked very doglike, Angielczyk said. Similar to reptiles, gorgonopsians didn’t have fur or visible ears, he said. But although the animal physically resembled lizards in some ways, please don’t call it a “lizard-dog,” he told CNN. “Lizards are a kind of reptile, and nonmammalian therapsids like gorgonopsians are part of a completely different evolutionary lineage, part of the lineage that includes mammals,” Angielczyk said. “While mammals and reptiles share a common ancestor that lived about 320 million years ago, they are separate lines of descent.” Gorgonopsians do share some traits with their mammal cousins. One of those is having teeth of different shapes and sizes, “with those teeth providing different roles in the feeding system,” Angielczyk said. “That’s something that’s very common in mammals today.” Unlike mammals, gorgonopsians seemingly replaced their teeth — including their long canines — repeatedly throughout their lifetime. “Mammals today, for the most part, just have one replacement cycle of teeth,” Angielczyk said. “Whereas gorgonopsians and other therapsids generally were more like a crocodile today, where they have teeth that are erupting continuously.” Paleontologists discovered bones of the newfound gorgonopsian in Mallorca, a Mediterranean island that’s part of Spain, during expeditions in 2019 and 2021, said senior study author Josep Fortuny, leader of the computational biomechanics and evolution of life history research group at the Miquel Crusafont Catalan Institute of Paleontology in Spain. “The most interesting thing about the specific specimen that we describe is its age. It is pretty certainly the oldest known gorgonopsian” as well as the oldest known therapsid to date, Fortuny told CNN in an email. “There is a big time gap in the fossil record of therapsids, between when they are predicted to have evolved based on our knowledge of relationships of synapsids (a larger vertebrate group that includes therapsids) and when they actually show up in the fossil record,” Fortuny said. Scientists have previously calculated that therapsid fossils should start showing up in rocks that are about 300 million years old, “and we don’t actually see them, up until now, until about 270 million years ago,” Angielczyk said. The new specimen, which dates back at least to that point in time and is likely even older, aligns with that gap, helping researchers to clarify when therapsids evolved. Fine-tuning the evolution of therapsids during the early part of the Permian Period (299 million to 252 million years ago) is particularly important for tracing the ancestry of mammals, said Roger Benson, Macaulay Curator of Dinosaur Paleobiology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. “Everything from the early Permian on the mammal line is outside of this group Therapsida, and all our knowledge of therapsids comes from the middle Permian and later,” said Benson, who was not involved in the research. “But paleontologists have long suspected there were therapsids before the middle Permian — we just didn’t find their fossils yet. This fossil is the most promising candidate for an early Permian therapsid so far.” The location of the find was also unusual. Gorgonopsid fossils were previously known only from arid, high-latitude sites in South Africa and Russia, the study authors reported. During the Permian, Mallorca was smack in the middle of the supercontinent Pangea, which existed from 335 million to 200 million years ago. In this equatorial zone, what’s now Mallorca would have experienced very wet and very dry seasons. “One of the things people have wondered is if maybe important events in mammal ancestry took place in the tropics, and we’ve been missing fossils of these types of animals at the right age to know about that,” Benson said. “That’s one of the intriguing implications of this fossil, is the potential that important events in mammal ancestry occurred at lower latitudes in environments that we haven’t sampled so much in the fossil record.” Finding the oldest documented gorgonopsian in Mallorca hints that the earliest therapsid fossils are yet to be discovered in places where paleontologists previously didn’t look for them, Angielczyk said. “It’s long been thought that the big temporal gap in the therapsid fossil record might correspond to more geographic sampling,” he said. “The fact that Mallorca is a new place for finding therapsids helps to support that idea that we’re not necessarily looking in the right places to find the first therapsids.”"
Fossilized poop reveals secrets of how dinosaurs came to dominate Earth,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/27/science/fossilized-poop-dinosaurs/index.html,"The earliest dinosaurs were unremarkable, bit players on a supercontinent crowded with other ancient reptiles when they first evolved around 230 million years ago. Fast-forward 30 million years, however, and dinosaurs dominated the planet, coming in all shapes, sizes and forms, while many of their reptilian counterparts had died off. Exactly why they were so evolutionarily successful is a long-standing mystery, but new research suggests some answers to this question may be contained in what they left behind: dinosaur droppings. “We know a lot about their lives and extinction but not how they came about,”  said Martin Qvarnström, lead author of a study on the rise of dinosaurs published Wednesday in the journal Nature and a paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden. To better understand the extinct giants, Qvarnström and his colleagues investigated overlooked fossils known as bromalites: remnants from the digestive system — aka dinosaur poop and vomit. They studied more than 500 fossils gathered over a 25-year period from around 10 sites in the Polish Basin, an area in the south of Poland. The remains dated back to a range of time spanning the Late Triassic to early Jurassic Period, from around 247 million years ago to 200 million years ago. “(Bromalites) contain so much paleoecological information, but I don’t think paleontologists really have acknowledged that and have seen them mostly as like a joke; you collect a few coprolites because it’s funny,” Qvarnström said, referring to fossilized feces. They found that the fossilized poop and vomit — scientifically known as coprolites and regurgitalites, respectively — increased in size and variety over time, indicating the emergence of larger animals and different diets. By studying the shape and contents of the bromalites and linking them to fossilized skeletons and footprints found at the sites, researchers were able to identify and categorize the animals that likely produced them. Doing so allowed the researchers to understand how many and what type and size of dinosaurs, as well as other vertebrate animals, were in the landscape at a given point in time. The analysis, which took 10 years to complete, allowed the team to piece together why dinosaurs came to prominence. In some cases, it was possible to make a visual assessment of what type of dinosaur was responsible for a bromalite based on a fossil’s size and shape — a spiral-shaped coprolite likely came from an animal with a spiral gut — but in many others, it was necessary to take a detailed 3D scan of the bromalite’s internal structure using specialized equipment to understand what the fossils contained. Ancient digestive remnants can “look like something left by your dog in the park and it’s very evident what they are. In other cases, especially herbivores, they’re more difficult to recognize,” he said. The team scanned the fossils’ internal structure at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. The massive facility, a ring-shaped synchrotron 844 meters (2,800 feet) in circumference, generates X-ray beams 10 trillion times brighter than medical X-rays and allows scientists to study matter at the molecular and atomic level. “It’s a bit like a CT scanner at the hospital. It works in the same way, but with much higher energy. We need that to get this really high resolution and also good contrast,” Qvarnström said. The coprolites contained the remains of fish, insects and plants, and sometimes other prey animals. Some remains were beautifully preserved, including tiny beetles and half-complete fish. Other coprolites contained bones crushed by predators. “The skeletal fossils, footprints and bromalites from sites in Poland provide a series of discrete temporal snapshots that demonstrate a transition from a world with few dinosaurs to one in which they dominated,” said Lawrence H. Tanner, a paleontologist at the department of biological and environmental sciences at Le Moyne College in New York. Tanner was not involved in the study. “Using the techniques from this study in other locations would provide a more global context and build a nuanced picture,” Tanner wrote in a commentary piece that published alongside the research. The authors came up with five phases to explain dinosaurs’ ascendancy: Their ancestors were omnivorous, eating plants and animals. They evolved into the first carnivorous and plant-eating, or herbivorous, dinosaurs. A key turning point came when increased volcanic activity may have led to a more diverse range of plants to feed upon, followed by the emergence of large and more diverse herbivore dinosaurs. In turn, this phase led to the evolution of the giant carnivorous dinosaurs beloved by movie directors and childhood books at the beginning of the Jurassic Period 200 million years ago. The supremacy of the dinosaurs endured until an asteroid that struck off the coast of what’s now Mexico 66 million years ago doomed the dinosaurs to extinction. Before this latest research, two theories had been proposed to explain the transition from a world dominated by non-dinosaurian reptiles to one in which the dinosaurs were ascendant, the study noted. One model suggested that dinosaurs evolved to physically outcompete their rivals, according to the study. The dinosaurs’ upright stance resulting from the positioning of their hind limbs directly beneath their body, combined with flexible ankles, made them highly agile and more efficient than their evolutionary competitors such as reptiles with splayed legs. Alternatively, some researchers believe dinosaurs were by chance better able to adapt to dramatic changes in climate that took place at the end of the Triassic. Qvarnström said the research based on the Polish fossils suggested a combination of the two hypotheses provided a more likely explanation, with a “complex interplay of several processes” that meant dinosaurs were better able to cope with how environmental shifts changed what food was available. For example, the study found that food residues extracted from bromalites belonging to dicynodonts, an ancient mammal relative with a turtle-shaped head,  suggested that creature had a restricted diet, feeding principally on conifers. It disappeared from the fossil record around 200 million years ago. Dinosaurs, on the other hand, appeared to eat a wide array of plants. For example, the team found that the contents of coprolites from the first large herbivorous dinosaurs, the sauropodomorphs, contained large quantities of tree ferns but also many other types of plants and charcoal. The team suspects that charcoal helped detoxify the ferns, which can be toxic. Grzegorz Niedźwiedzki, the study’s senior author and a paleontologist based at Uppsala’s department of organismal biology; evolution and development, said the reason behind the dinosaurs’ evolutionary success was a message that still applied today: “Eat your veggies and live longer.”"
"Baby saber-toothed cat mummy found in Siberia with intact skin, fur and toes is ‘mind-blowing,’ scientists say",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/18/science/mummified-sabre-toothed-cat-cub/index.html,"A mummified ice age cub from Siberia is the first known mummy of a saber-toothed cat, and its discovery is generating ripples of excitement among paleontologists. The mummy’s exceptional preservation provided the first view of what saber-toothed cats looked like. Written in its soft tissues are clues about where the cat’s muscles were bulkiest and how that may have shaped its hunting style. Abundant fur and mummified flesh covered the partial corpse, and its face, forelimbs and torso were nearly intact, scientists reported Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. The cub’s dark brown fur was short but very thick, measuring about 0.8 to 1.2 inches (20 to 30 millimeters) long. Its fur was also surprisingly soft, said lead study author Alexey V. Lopatin, full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow and chief researcher and director of the academy’s Borissiak Paleontological Institute. “It’s a fantastic feeling to see with your own eyes the life appearance of a long-extinct animal,” Lopatin told CNN in an email. “Especially when it comes to such an interesting predator as the sabre-toothed cat.” These extinct carnivores, which are distant relatives of modern big cats, are known for their long, bladelike canines, which could measure up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) long. The mummy is the first evidence from Asia of the saber-toothed cat species Homotherium latidens, Lopatin said, though fossilized bones were previously found at sites in the Netherlands and in the Canadian Yukon. Other types of frozen ice age mummies, such as woolly rhinos and mammoths, are known from the Siberian region of Yakutia in Russia. But mummified cats, by comparison, “are extremely rare,” Lopatin said. Before this discovery, there were just two known cat mummies, both cubs of the cave lion Panthera spelaea from Yakutia’s Uyandina River basin. “Now, we have added the Homotherium cub to this list,” Lopatin said. Extracting DNA from the mummy will be an important next step for understanding this species, as will more detailed examination of the mummy’s skeleton, muscles and hair, he added. Paleontologist Jack Tseng, who studies the anatomy of extinct mammals and was not involved in the discovery, was “at a loss for words” when he considered “the treasure trove of information that could come out of this singular discovery,” he told CNN. “It’s rare to find bones of this lineage in the first place, let alone soft tissue associated with it,” said Tseng, an associate professor in the integrative biology department at the University of California, Berkeley. “I don’t know if other paleontologists’ minds are as blown as mine, but it’s like reality changes now that we’ve seen this.” The cub was preserved in permafrost near the Badyarikha River in the northeast of Yakutia, and Yakutian diggers found the mummy in 2020 while prospecting for mammoth tusks under the supervision of Yakutian paleontologists, Lopatin told CNN in an email. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the cub was at least 35,000 years old and lived during the latter part of the Pleistocene epoch (about 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). Preservation of the cub’s forelimbs in particular was extraordinary, the study authors wrote. Its front paws even retained claws and the oval, fleshy pads on the underside of the paw that are fondly referred to as “beans” by admirers of modern cats. Along with the partial mummy, articulated bones of the cub’s pelvis and hind limbs were also found locked in ice. Based on comparisons with lion cub anatomy and analysis of the mummified cub’s incisor growth, scientists estimated that the cub was about 3 weeks old when it died. However, the mummy also showed that saber-toothed cubs differed dramatically from modern lion cubs of a similar age, Lopatin said. Its coat was darker, and its ears were smaller than those of lion cubs; it had longer forelimbs, a larger mouth opening and a more massive neck. The height of the mummy’s upper lip is more than twice that of a modern lion cub’s, probably so its lip could cover the long upper canines once they grew in, according to Lopatin. Its paw is also more circular than that of a lion cub; in fact, its shape more closely resembles the paw of a bear, Tseng added. Bears are known for using their powerful forearms to dig through trees and undergrowth for food; the size and shape of the mummified cub’s paws and front limbs suggest that an adult Homotherium may have also relied on its forearms, perhaps using them to immobilize its kills, he said. “The idea about saber-toothed cats is that they had to have some sort of assistance from the rest of the body — that it’s not just a headfirst hunting technique,” Tseng said. “And the forearm has been one of the targets of research to think about. Are they buffer in their forearms compared to modern big cats of similar sizes, because they need a forearm to help stabilize their prey so that the saber can be put to use?” Until now, scientists have hypothesized about saber-toothed cat anatomy by scanning fossils and digitally modeling the animals’ muscles in 3D, but that doesn’t compare to seeing one of those limbs “in the flesh,” Tseng said. “I think it makes it seem more possible that these saber-tooths would have used their forearms.” And it’s not just the anatomy of the Homotherium mummy that makes it so special — the discovery also provides a unique glimpse into the evolutionary history of the entire feline group, Tseng said. Prior genetic analysis of DNA from Homotherium fossils showed that the genus split from other ancient cats about 18 million years ago. Not only is the cub the sole mummified example of the Homotherium genus, “it represents a part of that cat family tree that goes back almost to the origin of the cat family,” he said. “That adds to the mind-blowingness of this discovery.”"
Ancient ‘terror birds’ were giant apex predators. Suspected new species is among the largest ever known,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/08/science/terror-bird-fossil-la-venta-colombia/index.html,"Millions of years ago, long-legged, big-beaked, meat-eating “terror birds” stalked the Americas. The imposing creatures ruled the roost as top predators of their terrestrial ecosystems, and scientists recently discovered one of the largest terror birds ever unearthed. When paleontologists analyzed a leg bone from a fossil site in Colombia called La Venta, they identified a terror bird — perhaps a new species — that lived about 12 million years ago and dwarfed many of its South American cousins. It would have topped 8 feet (2.5 meters) in height and weighed about 344 pounds (156 kilograms), scientists reported Monday in the journal Papers in Palaeontology. Most of the fossils of extinct terror birds, or phorusrhacids, come from sites in Argentina, and most species weighed between 11 pounds (5 kilograms) and 220 pounds (100 kilograms). “They are the only group of birds that achieved the role of terrestrial apex predators, evolving species that basically conquered South America during the Miocene  (about 23.03 million to 5.33 million years ago),” said paleontologist and lead study author Federico Javier Degrange, an independent researcher at the National University of Córdoba in Argentina. The suspected new species was slightly taller than a terror bird from what’s now Brazil called Paraphysornis brasiliensis, which stood nearly 8 feet (2.4 meters) tall. But P. brasiliensis was heavier than the La Venta giant, weighing more than 397 pounds (180 kilograms). A curator at the Museo La Tormenta in Colombia discovered the leg bone in the Tatacoa Desert nearly two decades ago, but paleontologists were uncertain about what type of animal to which it belonged. However, when Degrange saw the bone for the first time in 2023, the answer was obvious, he told CNN. Degrange has studied terror birds for almost 20 years, and he immediately recognized a structure in the front part of the bone that is only found in birds. And the oblique slant of the structure, among other features, told him that the bone belonged to a terror bird. While some terror bird fossils have been found in Florida and Texas, the specimen from La Venta is believed to be the northernmost terror bird from South America documented by scientists. The discovery in Colombia suggests that terror birds could thrive in diverse habitats and could help explain how and when phorusrhacids diversified northward, Degrange said. “Until the recovery of this animal, we had a huge geographical gap between Argentina and Brazil, where other terror birds are known, and in the States,” Degrange told CNN. “It tells us that, for terror birds, some species lived in more tropical environments,” he added. Placing terror birds in La Venta “is one step closer to understanding how terror birds finally got to North America,” Degrange said. During the Miocene Period, La Venta’s ecosystem was green, lush and humid, with large bodies of water, swamps, forests and grasslands. Hoofed mammals, which massive terror birds would likely have eaten, were common there. Other neighbors of terror birds would have included armadillo relatives called glyptodonts, a variety of perching and wading birds, and large crocodilians, according to the study. One such croc, a species of giant caiman measuring about 30 feet (9 meters) long named Purussaurus, left tooth marks gouged into the terror bird’s fossilized limb. But it’s impossible to say whether the croc chomped on the living bird or scavenged a meal after the bird was dead, Degrange said. Finding a terror bird in La Venta raises hope for unearthing more terror bird fossils in additional South American  locations — perhaps in Chile, said Karen Moreno, an adviser on paleontology at the National Monuments Council in Chile and an assistant professor at the Austral University of Chile’s Institute of Earth Sciences. Moreno was not involved in the study. The find also sheds new light on predator-prey relationships and ecological balance in  La Venta’s tropical habitat, she added. “We could say that dinosaurs (birds, as such) are still at the top of the food chain in the Miocene of South America,” Moreno said in an email. However, even top predators such as terror birds could still be vulnerable to environmental shifts, which may have eventually wiped out these avian giants. “The Miocene is an interesting period with huge climatic, oceanographic and paleogeographical changes,” Moreno said. “I think we are still far from answering what caused their extinction.” Another question that researchers are hoping to answer about the bird uncovered in La Venta — and terror birds in general — is how they evolved to become so massive, Degrange said. “We know that probably one of the drivers that led terror birds to get larger and larger was the competition between species of terror birds — but why that big?” he said. “I really hope to find more parts of the skeleton to better analyze the body size of this animal and the evolution of the whole terror bird group. Because everything about terror birds is fascinating.”"
Risks from ash and air pollution remain for people returning after wildfires. Here’s how to stay safe,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/health/la-wildfires-air-pollution-symptoms-safety/index.html,"As some people return to the structures spared from Los Angeles wildfires, experts warn that they should be careful of the air inside and especially cautious when cleaning up. Smoke, ash and all the toxic chemicals that come with both can seep into even well-sealed homes and pose risks to health. “There’s a lot that has potentially happened to affect poor air quality in your home, even if you haven’t suffered any physical damage to the home itself,” said Katherine Pruitt, national senior director for policy at the American Lung Association. “The fumes and the ash, the particles that are going to be in your indoor environment, are not safe to breathe. You especially don’t want to come into contact with the ash in your lungs, eyes or skin.” Los Angeles Public Health has declared a local health emergency for the entire county due to the fires. It prohibits the use of air blowers, including leaf blowers, in order to reduce health risks due to the ash and particulate matter from smoke. Wildfires burn a lot more than trees and grass. The burned cars and structures can release toxic chemicals. Even after fires die down and smoke dissipates, walls, floors, furniture and other indoor surfaces may absorb toxic chemicals and smoke. These surfaces can off-gas for weeks or even months, studies show, although that will reduce over time. Wildfires contribute to harmful fine particle pollution, which is at levels bad for human health in the area even before the wildfires. The American Lung Association’s State of the Air report for 2024 listed the Los Angeles area as one of the top 10 cities polluted by year-round particle pollution. It’s been No. 1 for ozone pollution for decades, Pruitt said. With the wildfires now on top of that, the air quality index has been sitting at “unhealthy” levels for many parts of Southern California for several days. Toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest that particle pollution from wildfires is more harmful to the respiratory system than equal doses of particle pollution from other causes. Exposure to particle pollution can make the eyes burn and the nose run, and it can embed deep in the lungs, leading to breathing problems such as bronchitis. The minuscule particles can also get into the bloodstream and cause inflammation, aggravating diabetes, chronic heart disease and other health conditions. A 2024 study of the Marshall Fire in the Boulder, Colorado, area showed that bad air hung around inside homes even after the smoke had cleared. Researchers found elevated levels of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ash, in addition to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air samples inside people’s homes. VOCs can be toxic to humans, and at least one VOC, benzene, is known to cause cancer. Exposure to PAHs is also associated with increased cancer incidence, according to the World Health Organization. When researchers in the Boulder study surveyed nearby residents, they reported symptoms related to the smoke and ash including headaches, coughing, sneezing, sore throat and watery eyes even six months after the 2021 fire. Those who lived closer to burned-out buildings reported more symptoms. The number of people reporting symptoms declined a year after the fire, but even two years out, about a third of those surveyed reported at least one smoke- and ash-related symptom. There are some ways to reduce exposure to these harmful substances if you’re in an area affected by wildfires. The US Environmental Protection Agency recommends checking HVAC filters every few days and changing them if they look dirty. A clean filter is much more effective at protecting inside air. People who have HVAC systems that use a high-efficiency filter (MERV-13 or higher) should run the system’s fan as often as possible by putting the fan to “On” rather than the “Auto” setting. Portable air cleaners can help, too. Those with HEPA filters and charcoal filters work best, Pruitt said. The EPA suggests putting air cleaners in rooms where people spend the most time and running them as often as possible on the highest fan speed until any smells go away. The EPA also suggests limiting activities that can create even more fine particle pollution, such as frying or broiling food. Avoid vacuuming unless the vacuum has a HEPA filter, and don’t smoke or vape indoors. Although there may be a lingering smell from the wildfire, don’t burn candles or incense inside, which just creates more particle pollution. And soap and water are best for cleaning, rather than aerosols or chemical cleaners that may interact with some of the chemicals in ash. Don’t try to clean with a traditional vacuum or broom, which will just push the tiny particles into the air. If you’re using a vacuum with a HEPA filter, start by misting surfaces with water to keep ash from floating around. When cleaning, wear gloves, goggles, long sleeves and long pants and socks to protect skin, and use a N95 or a P100 respirator mask to keep from breathing in ash. “Not a surgical mask. Not a cloth mask. Those aren’t good enough to keep out those very fine particles and some of the gases that you might need to worry about,” Pruitt said. Ash should be washed off skin as quickly as possible. Before leaving a cleanup site, change clothes so ash doesn’t get tracked into the car or into other locations. People who have heart or lung diseases like asthma or COPD, the elderly, children and pregnant people should all avoid ash cleanup work because particle pollution is particularly hard on their systems. Older and younger bodies have a harder time expelling pollution from their lungs. Pets should be kept out of the ash since they are also more susceptible to getting sick. Wash their paws if they do walk through it. And no matter how quickly you’re trying to clean, Pruitt said, it’s good to take fresh air breaks frequently. “Hopefully, the outdoor air will have cleared up and you can open up the house and start to air it out,” she said. “If the outdoor air is still smoky, create a clean room with an air cleaner so you can go in there and take a break. And if you experience any symptoms like breathing problems or pain or discomfort, stop cleaning and check with your health care provider before you continue.”"
Wildfires are a threat to mental health that can linger even years later,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/health/wildfires-impact-mental-health/index.html,"Dr. Jyoti Mishra personally knows how much stress can come with a wildfire. The associate director of the UC Climate Change and Mental Health Council and associate professor of psychiatry works at the University of California, San Diego. Her city isn’t currently experiencing wildfires, but her LA-based family has fled to her home. “All our family from LA is here with us, and we’re happy they’ve made it,” Mishra said Thursday. “We’re hoping their home is safe up there, but we don’t know yet.” Uncertainty about losing a home or a neighborhood is one factor, studies have showed, that can contribute to an increase in mental health problems among people who experience wildfires. Mishra’s research on the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California showed that people who were personally affected by wildfires were significantly more likely to have anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress than members of communities that had not been exposed to a fire. “It can also make you feel cognitively impacted, as well,” Mishra said. “Our work has shown that it’s hard to pay attention to a singular thing when everything around you feels like it’s threatening you.” That means the hundreds of thousands of people who are under evacuation orders or warnings amid some of the worst wildfires in the history of the Los Angeles area face threats not just their physical safety but also their mental health – and not just immediately after the fire passes. Mishra’s studies have also showed that some people experienced problems months, or even years, after wildfires. In the immediate term, several studies have found, wildfires can be destabilizing and cause people to feel stressed and to experience feelings of anger, sadness, shock, depression and frustration. People may also lose their appetites, have trouble sleeping or have nightmares, and they may turn to drugs or alcohol to self-medicate, studies show. Depression, anxiety and trauma can affect even more people long-term, even if they never had such mental health concerns before, and research shows that post-traumatic stress disorder can linger three months to even a decade past a wildfire. It isn’t just the uncertainty of knowing what happens to your neighborhood. It’s also the smoke itself, according to Dr. Yang Liu, chair of environmental health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. His 2024 study showed an association between emergency department visits for anxiety disorders and exposure to wildfire smoke. The effect was more pronounced in women, girls and older adults, with major smoke events significantly amplifying this risk. “Inhaling a lot of smoke can trigger an anxiety disorder. LA’s air quality level is 10 to 20 times above the national center, so it’s certainly a severe smoke event for the entire Southern California region. Certainly, the LA metro region is engulfed by heavy smoke,” Liu said. People should protect their physical and mental health by staying out of the smoke as much as possible, he said. “People should take precautions and close windows, avoid doing outdoor activities, and if they have a HEPA filter in their A/C system or a standalone air filter, they should turn it on,” Liu said. It’s not just adults who should take precautions. Although children can be more resilient, Cedars-Sinai child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Sabrina Renteria said, they can also feel more helpless when a wildfire is in the area. Renteria said the fires have not reached where she lives in Marina del Rey, but her house keeps losing power from the strong winds, and the Cedars-Sinai emergency room where she works often sees more children with mental health concerns when there are wildfires. “We absolutely anticipate that this will have a huge uptick in mental health issues with children,” Renteria said. Children are intuitive, she said, and can sense when something is wrong, so adults need to help them cope by being honest about what’s happening and talking to them about how they’re feeling. “I think openly communicating with their child, saying ‘yes, I’m feeling really sad today.’ Or explaining that ‘there’s a lot of things around us that’s been troubling me,’ and you can give examples, but then you can talk to them about how you’re going to cope with this,” Renteria said. Children and adults alike should get professional help if feelings like anxiety or depression linger. Renteria said it’s also important to get children back to their routine, classes and friends as quickly as they can, to whatever extent is possible. “Just so they have this sense of stability, because children can be very easily destabilized when their routine is sporadic,” she said. Teens and children mimic their parents and loved ones, “so it’s also very important that, if you’re experiencing a tragedy, that you practice and display good coping mechanisms,” Renteria said. “So it’s important for a parent to take care of themselves, as well.” Something as simple as listening to music can help the body destress naturally, she said; so can deep-breathing exercises. “It helps slow your body’s natural response to anxiety and stimulates the vagus nerve, and it calms your whole body,” Renteria said. Mishra also recommends mindfulness exercises. Being mindful and present in the moment and not letting the traumas of the past slip into the present can help heal the brain, she said. Volunteering to help people in the community can be healing, Renteria suggests. Talking with others who also experienced the wildfires can also help children and adults acknowledge how they’re feeling and to find common ground in their experiences, but it’s important to be aware of how they’re responding. “When you’re communicating with other people, it shouldn’t be a bunch of doom and gloom, especially in front of your child. And for teachers too, since children take cues from their elders,” she said. Children and adults should limit how much news and social media they see. Adults could also check out news stories before watching them with their children and then have a conversation about them. They might want to use the stories as an opportunity to point out the good work first responders and volunteers are doing. “In many times, for these kinds of disasters, we put them in this framework of doom and gloom, but we need to shift that to a survive-and-thrive framework, where the planet that we have is just one planet and that if we all work together, we can make better things happen,” Mishra said. People also need to be careful not to isolate themselves in the wake of the wildfires, she said. Those who have stronger family connections and community support are more resilient, her research shows. “Collective healing is needed,” Mishra said. People who are watching the wildfires from far away should be sure to keep friends and family in California in mind. “Definitely reach out to others,” Mishra said. There are also ways to help meet the basic needs of people who fled their homes quickly, without food or funds, by contributing directly. “Just so that they can get by on a day-to-day basis and focus on rebuilding instead of having to worry about where they are going to get dinner today,” Mishra said. “These are just little things that we can all help out with others, because eventually, with climate change, this is not something that’s isolated to a region. It may happen one day to any of us.”"

"Rising HMPV cases in China are ‘what we would expect to see’ in winter, health officials say",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/health/human-metapneumovirus-hmpv-cases-china-us/index.html,"As China experiences a rise in respiratory infections this winter, one little-known virus has gotten a lot of attention – and some people may worry whether the rise in cases could be felt more broadly around the world. Human metapneumovirus, also known as HMPV, can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, and data from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released last week shows that the country has seen more cases in recent weeks. But HMPV typically circulates in the Northern Hemisphere in winter, and China’s CDC data shows that there have also been rises in a number of other common respiratory infections, including the seasonal flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. “China’s reported levels of respiratory infections are within the normal range. It’s what we would expect to see for the winter season,” Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, said in a news briefing Tuesday. To calm concerns, she added that hospital utilization in China is lower than at this time last year and that there have been no emergency declarations or emergency responses launched in the country in connection with these respiratory infections. “Regarding human metapneumovirus, it’s not a new virus,” Harris said. “It was first identified in 2001. It’s been in the human population for a long time. It is a common virus that circulates in winter and spring.” In the United States, the CDC tracks cases of HMPV in the same way it tracks the spread of other respiratory viruses. It’s estimated that about 10% to 12% of respiratory illnesses in children are caused by HMPV; most people will get HMPV at some point before age 5, and then reinfections can occur throughout life. Data shows that HMPV cases started to show up more frequently in November and have been rising since. But, compared with other common viruses, the weekly percent of respiratory infections testing positive for HMPV has been low, at 1.94% as of December 28. In comparison, flu was at 18.71% and Covid-19 at 7.10% that week. “It’s respiratory virus season for a reason. We’ve gotten very accustomed to thinking about those that have been really severe – so Covid, as well as flu and RSV – but there are a host of other respiratory viruses out there that you can get sick with,” said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. When it comes to common respiratory infections like HMPV, “many times, you get better on your own, but not necessarily always,” Hamilton said. “Typically, infections are relatively mild, and we often think about it like the common cold,” she added. “Many people don’t necessarily know when they have a common cold that it is caused by human metapneumovirus, but it’s definitely one of the viruses that are often associated with the common cold.” Some of the symptoms commonly associated with HMPV infections include cough, fever, stuffy nose and shortness of breath. HMPV spreads from person to person in a similar way as some other respiratory viruses: through droplets from coughing or sneezing and through touch, such as shaking hands or touching contaminated surfaces. “Simple measures can prevent spread. And these include, if you’re sick, if you’ve got symptoms, stay home,” Harris said. “Also, if you’re in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces, when you know that there’s a virus currently circulating, think about wearing a mask. Improve ventilation where you can,” she said. “And of course, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue.” Some people are at increased risk of severe infections with HMPV, Harris said. “In some cases, like any of the common cold viruses, it can lead to more severe disease in people who’ve got no immunity or have got very weak immune systems,” she said. “That’s the very young. That’s newborn babies – that’s why you don’t go and visit a newborn baby and kiss it when you’ve got a cold – and the very old. Again, that’s why you should not go and visit your over-90 great-grandmother in hospital when you’ve got a cold.” Health care providers can test for HMPV, but there is no vaccine, and there is no specific antiviral therapy to treat infections. Resting at home and staying hydrated can help with symptoms, as well as some over-the-counter medications. Mild cases of HMPV usually last a few days to a week, and many people recover by themselves within two to five days. “It will present in the same way as flu, sars-cov-2, RSV, so the same advice applies for those affected – rest, take on fluids, try not to spread it to others,” John Tregoning, a professor in vaccine immunology at Imperial College London, said in a statement distributed Monday by the UK-based Science Media Centre. “If you do feel very unwell go to your GP,” he said. “As it is a virus, antibiotics won’t have any effect.”"
"To heal America’s ills, outgoing surgeon general offers ‘parting prescription’: stronger community",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/health/surgeon-general-parting-prescription-community/index.html,"As US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy nears the end of his second term as the nation’s doctor, a final diagnosis of his patient suggests that a great deficiency of connectivity has led to a poor prognosis for America’s overall health and well-being. To treat the “widespread pain and unhappiness” that has left the country deeply unwell, he says, his “parting prescription” for the American people is to cultivate a strong sense of community to help themselves and others. “Community is a powerful source of life satisfaction and life expectancy,” Murthy wrote in an essay published Tuesday. “It’s where we know each other, help each other, and find purpose in contributing to each other’s lives.” Building community creates fulfillment, he said, and there are three key elements that make it possible: connection with others through relationships, acts of service to help others and a sense of purpose in life – all pursued through love, instead of fear or hate. “Relationships, service, and purpose are the time-tested triad of fulfillment that stands in contrast to wealth, fame, and power which define the modern-day triad of success,” Murthy wrote. “The triad of success is focused on the individual. The triad of fulfillment connects us with something bigger than the individual,” the surgeon general said. “The triad of success may earn us praise and possessions. The triad of fulfillment gives us meaning and belonging.” The US surgeon general typically serves as the voice of the administration’s public health policy while promoting their own agenda of issues that they feel are important to the health of American people. This final reflection from Murthy captures themes from his work under multiple administrations, first from 2014 to 2017 under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump and a second term under President Joe Biden since 2021. His initiatives have focused on the addiction crisis, youth mental health, loneliness and isolation, workplace well-being, parental stress and social media’s impact on youth. “Social media has turbocharged a culture of constant comparison that too often undermines our self-worth and makes us feel dissatisfied with our lives,” Murthy wrote Tuesday. “Trying to fill our internal void with approval and accolades and addictive forces isn’t helping.” Although Murthy’s latest reflection pulls from personal experience and is not meant to be a scientific report, it does cite about two dozen studies that help show how social connectivity can affect physical and mental health. “Being socially disconnected increases our risk of heart disease, dementia, depression, anxiety, and premature death,” he wrote, yet about a third of adults and half of young people experience loneliness. Individual purpose, anchored in helping others, can also strengthen physical and mental health, Murthy said. “A high sense of individual purpose may reduce the risk of early death as well as stroke, lung disease, and dementia for some. Research also shows that people with a strong sense of purpose may experience lower levels of depression and anxiety and greater resilience in the face of stress,” he wrote, citing five different studies. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated feelings of loneliness and isolation in the US, Murthy said, but divisiveness has been eroding the country’s well-being for even longer. “It is fueling not only illness and despair on an individual level, but also pessimism and distrust across society which have all made it painfully difficult to rise together in response to common challenges,” he wrote. “As I finish my tenure as Surgeon General, this is my parting prescription, my final wish for all of us: Choose community.” Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a New York family physician and Fox News medical contributor, is Trump’s pick to replace Murthy as surgeon general in his new administration. Several health experts have said that she’s a reasonable choice but that she may be tested with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, as Trump’s pick to helm the US Department of Health and Human Services."
Is bird flu the next pandemic? What to know after the first H5N1 death in the US,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/health/bird-flu-h5n1-pandemic-risk-explained/index.html,"With reports of the first human death from bird flu in the US, some Americans are feeling an uncomfortable flashback to the early days of Covid-19, when infectious disease experts were talking about a new virus that was sending people to the hospital with respiratory infections. Although both viruses can cause breathing problems, they are very different. Covid was spreading easily from person to person when it arrived in the US in 2020, but bird flu has been lurking for years, mostly as a problem for animals. Scientists also know a lot more about H5N1 bird flu than they did the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the US has been preparing for the threat of a new flu outbreak for a long time. Still, the virus is making moves that deserve attention. Here’s what you need to know about H5N1. Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a broad term that refers to several types of influenza that normally infect birds. The bird flu that’s been making news in the United States is a virus called H5N1. Some flu viruses carried by birds cause only mild infections and are classified as low-pathogenic viruses. In contrast, H5N1 often kills birds that catch it, so it is classified as a highly pathogenic avian influenza. To complicate matters, although bird flu viruses primarily prey on birds, they can also spread to other animals, including humans. Human infections with bird flu viruses are rare, and they’re usually what scientists call dead-end infections because they don’t typically transmit from person to person. You may have heard of H5N1 only recently, but it’s not a new virus. Scientists have been tracking it for almost three decades. It was first identified in geese in Southern China in 1996. Over the years, it has caused sporadic outbreaks in wild and farmed birds around the globe. The virus reappeared in North America in late 2021, and it quickly caught scientists’ attention because it seemed to have broadened its repertoire, spreading beyond birds and infecting a growing variety of mammals. In the current wave of infections, it has spread to more than 48 species in at least 26 countries. It has caused mass die-offs of marine mammals too, including 24,000 sea lions that died in South America in 2023. In February 2024, Dr. Jeremy Farrar, who is chief scientist at the World Health Organization, called the ongoing spread of H5N1 “a pandemic of animals.” Since 2022, more than 130 million wild and farmed birds have been affected in America across all 50 states, 919 dairy herds have tested positive in 16 states, and 66 people have tested positive in 10 states, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture. Scientists agree that the virus would need to evolve – or retain key changes in its genetic sequence – to start a pandemic. Each time a virus infects a cell and copies itself, it makes mistakes. Usually, these mistakes are benign or even harmful for the virus, but occasionally, there’s a genetic change that helps the virus become better at infecting cells. Given the right set of circumstances, that version of the virus may outcompete others and continue to survive, going on to infect new hosts or new kinds of hosts. Flu viruses can change in another way, too Each virus has eight segments, and like kids in a lunch room, they are always looking to swap. When two viruses trade whole segments, it’s called a reassortment, and it result in quick and sometimes dramatic changes to a virus’ abilities. Scientists say either type of change could spell trouble for humans. Although the H5N1 virus is very good at infecting birds and has become a threat for many different kinds of mammals, including dairy cows, it’s still pretty clumsy at infecting people. In cows, for example, the H5N1 virus primarily infects the mammary glands. This causes a dramatic drop in milk production but usually doesn’t kill the cow. In people, the main route of infection seems to be through the eyes; conjunctivitis, or red, inflamed eyes, seems to be the telltale symptom of infection. Scientists think H5N1 infects the eyes because flu viruses enter cells through sugars on their surface called sialic acids. Birds – and human eyes – primarily have alpha 2,3 sialic acid receptors on their cells. But a different kind of sialic acid receptor, alpha 2,6, is more prevalent in the human respiratory tract. Human flu viruses, including those that cause seasonal influenza, have evolved to infect cells through alpha 2,6 receptors. Given enough time in the human body, the bird flu virus has shown the ability to change to become better at infecting different kinds of cells and tissues, spreading from the eyes to the respiratory tract, for example. Researchers detected key changes to the genome of the virus in teenager in Canada who became severely ill with H5N1 in November. Those changes probably helped it infect cells in her respiratory tract. Samples of the H5N1 virus that infected a severely ill patient in Louisiana also showed signs of adaptation to human cells. Infectious disease experts warn that as the virus continues to spread, it’s more likely that it changes to become a fully human pathogen. When humans have become infected, it’s almost always through contact with infected animals. Nearly all of these so-called spillover infections have been mild. And no one who has gotten H5N1 in the US is known to have given the infection to anyone else. The CDC and state public health departments are monitoring farm workers who test positive and following everyone they’ve been around while ill, a practice called contact tracing, to see if they get sick. State public health labs are also sequencing all influenza A viruses detected through routine flu testing. So far, only two bird flu infections in people have been detected this way. The CDC estimates that the current risk to the public is low. If you become ill within 10 days of contact with sick or dead animals or their droppings, make sure to alert a health care provider to your exposure. Although most of the H5N1 samples have been handled by the state public health laboratory system, the CDC has been working to expand testing, and large commercial laboratories such as Quest and Labcorp now have tests that can detect H5 viruses. That means it is easier for doctors to test patients if they suspect a bird flu infection. The two groups of people who are most at risk are dairy and poultry workers and people who have backyard bird flocks, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. The virus homes in on the udders of milking cows, and studies have found high concentrations of bird flu virus in raw milk. The milking parlors of dairies are wet environments, and workers can be infected if they get a splash of raw milk in their eyes or if they get milk on their hands and then rub their eyes. Droplets of virus-laden milk can also become airborne if they spray from milking equipment. Birds shed the virus through their saliva, mucus and feces, and it can become airborne when their litter and feathers are churned up in barns, particularly during culling operations. “It can be in the air,” Osterholm said. “So it’s not even just contact touching the birds, but just the dander and all the dust that occurs when you’re dealing with birds.” One of the most prominent symptoms in infected farm workers has been red, irritated eyes. A recent study of the first 46 human cases in the current outbreak in the US found that 93% had conjunctivitis. For about a third of the total, that was their only symptom. The second most common symptom, experienced by about half of infected farm workers, was a fever. About a third of people with H5N1 had respiratory symptoms, but these were most common among poultry workers who were exposed during bird depopulation activities. Two people in North America have had severe infections. The first was the 13-year-old girl in Canada, who became critically ill with lung and kidney failure and was put on life support for two weeks to give her organs time to recover. It’s not clear how she was exposed to the virus. The second person, from Louisiana, was hospitalized with severe respiratory symptoms after exposure to a backyard flock and wild birds. That person, who was over age 65 and had underlying medical conditions, died this month, becoming the first death in the US from bird flu. Both of these patients had the D1.1 strain of the virus, which is circulating in wild birds. It’s different from the B3.13 virus that has been infecting workers on dairy farms. Researchers are investigating whether the D1.1 strain might cause more severe disease. Milk and meat that have been heated to kill germs are safe. Even before H5N1 was a consideration, health officials cautioned against drinking raw milk or eating undercooked meat because both can harbor nasty germs like salmonella and E. coli. Cats have died from drinking raw milk on farms. Studies by the US Food and Drug Administration show that common pasteurization methods neutralize the virus, but refrigeration doesn’t. USDA studies show that cooking meat to a safe temperature inactivates the virus. A recent study from Stanford University that involved lacing raw milk with flu virus and then testing it on cells in a lab found that the virus could still infect cells for up to five days after being refrigerated. No human infections have been linked to raw milk consumption, although a toddler in California recently tested positive for the flu after drinking a large amount of raw milk. The CDC wasn’t able to confirm the infection, so this child is listed as a suspected case."

"Doctors, nurses press ahead as wildfires strain Los Angeles’ health care",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/health/health-care-strain-los-angeles-wildfires-kff/index.html,"The rapidly spreading wildfires that have transformed much of Los Angeles County into a raging hellscape are not only upending the lives of tens of thousands of residents and business owners, but also stressing the region’s hospitals, health clinics, first responders, and nursing homes. At least one medical clinic burned down. Senior patients were evacuated by ambulance from nursing facilities as embers swirled around them and their providers. Medical offices have closed, and routine appointments have been canceled. Some providers have lost homes or had to evacuate their neighborhoods, keeping them from work in many cases and making it a challenge for some health care centers to maintain sufficient staffing. Amid the maelstrom, doctors, nurses, and other caregivers did their jobs. On Tuesday night, Ravi Salgia, an oncologist at City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, saw the house above his Eaton Canyon home go up in flames. As debris and sparks fell, he, his wife, and their older daughter estimated they had no more than seven minutes to get out. In the middle of the night, Salgia got a call that the hospital had become an emergency command center and was at risk of evacuation, meaning he needed to help evaluate patients and make discharge preparations. Salgia arrived at the hospital at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday. He was joined by colleagues, many of whom had also evacuated their homes. “We all felt very strongly that we needed to take care of our patients — no matter what’s happening to us physically and emotionally, what’s happening to our houses — that we need to make sure that the people we serve were taken care of,” Salgia said in an interview. He doesn’t know if his house is still standing. In Pacific Palisades, St. John’s Physician Partners, a primary care and pediatric clinic affiliated with Providence Health & Services, burned down, said Patricia Aidem, a spokesperson for the large Catholic hospital chain based in Renton, Washington. Not far from the eastern edge of the Palisades Fire, Providence St. John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, one of the group’s major LA-area hospitals, was so close to evacuating that it called other hospitals in the area to find space for patients who would be displaced, Aidem said. USC Verdugo Hills Hospital, in Glendale, also faced potential evacuation, along with other hospitals in the region. “All hospitals in close proximity to the fires remain on high alert and are prepared to evacuate if conditions worsen,” the Hospital Association of Southern California said in a statement. “The fires are creating significant operational hurdles,” the association added. The association also said emergency services have been strained by high call volumes, while road closures have impeded the transport of patients, supplies, and health care workers. Some health facilities have been hit by power outages, the association said, while “many staff members are directly impacted by evacuations and fire-related disruptions, further complicating operations.” The California Department of Managed Health Care on Thursday ordered health plans to ensure enrollees affected by wildfires have access to all needed medical services, including prescription drug refills. Aidem said some doctors and other health workers at Providence St. John’s in Santa Monica and Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in the San Fernando Valley have lost homes or been evacuated, making them miss work and creating challenges to ensure adequate staffing. Hospitals across the county said their emergency rooms had treated patients for burns, smoke inhalation, and eye irritation. Over 700 people — and possibly far more — have been evacuated from nursing homes and other care facilities, according to the California Department of Public Health. On Wednesday, West Valley Health Center, operated by Los Angeles County’s Department of Health Services, closed due to a power outage, the department said. And UCLA Health said the closure of some of its clinics in Pasadena and on L.A.’s Westside was due partly to “utility shutoffs.” Children’s Hospital Los Angeles said two of its specialty care clinics, in Encino and Santa Monica, were closed Thursday “due to the impacts from the wind storm, power outages and wild fires.” Providence also has shut several clinics this week. The two biggest blazes, the Palisades Fire in the parched coastal hills of western L.A. County and the Eaton Fire on the Eastside, have together torched more than 50 square miles, burned thousands of structures, reduced beloved cultural landmarks to ashes, killed at least 24 people, and severely injured many more. The monster winds that fueled the explosion of the fires on Tuesday and Wednesday have begun to quiet down, though significant gusts are still expected to complicate the task of firefighters for the next several days. Routine medical care will likely be disrupted for thousands in the days ahead. Kaiser Permanente, the giant HMO and medical provider, said it closed multiple medical sites Thursday due to the fires, including a pharmacy and laboratory and an eye clinic. Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, close to the Eaton Fire, said some of its outpatient offices were affected by evacuation notices and heavy smoke. Dignity Health, another large health system, said some of its hospitals were operating on generator power due to high winds, and some, including Glendale Memorial Hospital, had canceled elective surgeries. Other hospitals, including USC Verdugo Hills and Providence St. John’s, temporarily halted nonemergency surgeries due to the impact of the wildfires. Christine Kirmsse, a registered nurse, evacuated her Santa Monica home on Wednesday night and is staying at a hotel an hour away. But she said she feels strongly that she needs to come into work. “There’s obviously so much help that’s needed,” Kirmsse said. “And it’s important to me because I have the skills to be able to help. In times like this, this is when community is the most powerful.” KFF Health News’ Chaseedaw Giles and Tarena Lofton contributed to this report.

Dementia risk is rising in an aging US population. Cases are projected to double by 2060,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/health/dementia-risk-cases-double-aging-us-population/index.html,"New research suggests that the risk for developing dementia is significantly higher than previously estimated, and the burden on the United States population will grow substantially over the next few decades. Overall, more than 2 in 5 people over the age of 55 in the US – about 42% – will develop dementia in their later years, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. As the US population ages, the number of people diagnosed with dementia each year is projected to double – from about 514,000 cases in 2020 to about 1 million a year by 2060. Much of this trend will be driven by the large cohort of Baby Boomers reaching older age, the researchers wrote. The Boomer generation, born from 1946 to 1964, is the second largest in the US after their children, the Millennials, according to the US Census Bureau: There were about 73 million people in the Boomer generation in 2020, the youngest of whom are now at least 60 years old. By 2040, all Baby Boomers will be at least 75 years old, an age after which dementia diagnoses were found to increase substantially. Only about 17% of cases were diagnosed before age 75, according to the new research, with an average age of 81. For this study, researchers tracked the health records of about 15,000 people, following each patient for an average of 23 years. Their data was more diverse than previous studies that have estimated dementia prevalence, with Black people representing more than a quarter of participants, and more comprehensive measures to capture diagnoses. The shifting racial makeup of the US population may also play a role in the rise of dementia cases, the researchers said, with higher-risk minority groups expected to comprise more than half of the US population by 2045. The researchers found “striking differences” in dementia risk by race, with significantly higher diagnoses rates among Black adults and earlier onset compared to White adults. Annual dementia diagnoses among Black adults may triple by 2060, according to the new estimates. “Racial disparities in dementia may reflect the cumulative effects of structural racism and inequality throughout the life course,” the researchers wrote. “For instance, poor access to education and nutrition may contribute to earlier differences in cognitive reserve, and socioeconomic disparities and limited access to care may lead to a higher burden of vascular risk factors at midlife.” Older women have a higher overall risk of developing dementia in their lifetime than older men – about 48% compared with 35%, the new research estimates – but much of that difference is due to the fact that women tend to live longer. And older adults with a particular gene – apolipoprotein E, or APOE, which is involved with the process of carrying cholesterol and other fat through the bloodstream – are also at higher risk. Older adults with two copies of the gene had a 59% risk of developing dementia in their older age, compared with 48% of those with one copy and 39% of those with no copies of the gene, the new study found. While the rising burden from dementia is driven largely by age and genetic factors, experts say that there are “broad opportunities” to reduce risk in the population with better management of certain lifestyle factors such as a healthy weight and diet, mental health and hearing loss. “Accumulating data from clinical trials have linked healthy lifestyle behaviors, the absence of vascular risk factors and hearing rehabilitation with improved cognitive outcomes,” the researchers wrote. “However, only approximately 20% of US adults are meeting recommended lifestyle and cardiovascular health targets, and only approximately 30% of older adults with hearing loss are using a hearing aid.” And for the first time, new diagnosis criteria published by the nonprofit Alzheimer’s Association in July, calls on doctors diagnosing the condition to rely on biomarkers — pieces of beta amyloid and tau proteins picked up by lab tests or on brain scans — rather than pen-and-paper tests of memory and thinking. The novel diagnosis criteria aims to catch Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, in its earliest and most treatable stages – with novel drugs that aim to slow the progress of the disease on the horizon. But the clinical trials for those drugs have been “plagued by a lack of racial diversity,” experts say. The findings from the new research highlight an “urgent need for policies that enhance healthy aging, with a focus on health equity,” the researchers wrote. “Policies that enhance prevention and healthy aging are urgent public health priorities for reducing the substantial and growing burden of dementia.” CNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report."

"What you should know about ‘whole-body’ deodorant, according to experts",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/health/whole-body-deodorant-wellness/index.html,"As if drugstore aisles weren’t already overflowing with dozens of conventional and natural underarm deodorants, an array of sticks, creams and sprays from heavily marketed big brands now promises “whole-body” odor control. The products often come labeled with explicit or less than subtle nods to private areas. “It is clearly a trend right now,” said Dr. Marisa Plescia, vice president of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists, a professional association representing the cosmetics and personal care industry. “Obviously we know that there are other areas that do have a tendency to have some body odor — areas, like the groin, that can be a little bit more susceptible to microbial growth,” she continued. And after the success of small brands offering products for smelly pits, odiferous nether regions and everything in between in the past several years, “now everybody is like, ‘OK, we need to launch an allover deodorant.” Options abound. Here’s what full-body deodorants do — and how to tell them apart, according to experts. Many of the products marketed for allover use are functionally the same as traditional deodorants or body sprays. They often have powdery elements that absorb sweat — such as arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) powder, tapioca starch and magnesium carbonate — along with fragrances to mask odor. Most don’t contain sweat-controlling aluminum salts like traditional antiperspirants, but some do. Where it gets interesting, said Dr. Chris Adigun, a dermatologist in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, is in innovative products that incorporate antimicrobial compounds, which target the bacteria that cause stink. “If you don’t mind sweating, then these are actually great products. They actually do work,” she said. One such ingredient is mandelic acid, a gentle alpha hydroxy acid that’s known to kill bacteria on the skin (though the mechanism of how isn’t entirely clear to researchers). This AHA is the heavy hitter in Lume, the trailblazer of the allover deodorant market, and its brother brand, Mando. Another example is magnesium hydroxide, a common ingredient in natural deodorants. It increases the pH on the skin, making the environment less acidic and therefore less hospitable to odor-causing bacteria such as Staphylococcus hominis and Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, Plescia said. The Curie brand, made famous on the reality TV show “Shark Tank,” attacks bacteria with good old-fashioned witch hazel, along with a cadre of newer ingredients used to keep bacterial growth in check. Those ingredients are byproducts of the Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces bacteria commonly found on skin — what Plescia calls “post-biotics.” “I think it’s really interesting that we’re finally attacking body odor in a better way,” Adigun said, pointing out that dermatologists regularly treat persistent body odor with topical prescription antibiotics. But they are only applied to the armpits, she added. From a biological perspective, should you add allover deodorant to your daily routine? Experts say no. “We don’t stink everywhere. So I don’t see why we need to put deodorant everywhere,” Adigun said. There are sweat glands all over the body. But only a small portion of them are responsible for body odor. Called apocrine glands, they are primarily concentrated in the armpits and around the groin. They release sweat that’s rife with fats and proteins that provide an all-you-can-eat buffet for S. hominis and other members of the skin’s microbiome. Body odor is the product of these bacteria digesting the victuals in apocrine sweat and producing pungent compounds that we perceive as BO. The majority of your sweat glands don’t provide such a nutritional bounty and therefore don’t give rise to odor. On a more philosophical level, do you need full-body deodorant? Also no. Plescia doesn’t appreciate the implication that we smell bad and need to put something all over our bodies to smell better. In the past, she said, body sprays from Bath & Body Works or Axe were marketed for their scents. “Now, though, we’re seeing it as: ‘You need to use products all over your body to help you not smell,’” Plescia noted. “Is that really a great message to people?” Adigun added that the message is particularly disconcerting when it’s aimed at women. “There is a part of me that struggles with the marketing when they’re like, ‘Yes, everywhere, including your private areas,’” she said. “We have a culture problem of telling women that they’re dirty.” As with anything you wipe, spray or rub on your body, there is a chance that some ingredient could irritate your skin. “Unfortunately, many of my patients that have more sensitive skin find all the whole-body deodorants irritating,” said Dr. Jeanine Downie, a dermatologist in Montclair, New Jersey. Common irritants include pentylene glycol, phenylpropanol, potassium hydroxide and fragrance. Adigun stressed that people with vaginas need to be careful about what they put near them. The skin in the area is very sensitive, and the vagina supports a delicate balance of microflora. Bacteria-killing ingredients can disrupt that balance, potentially leading to yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis. Even if a product’s instructions say that it’s for external use only, the line between external and internal is not always clear. If you don’t have sensitive skin and like the way deodorant creams and sprays feel and smell, there is nothing concerning about using them. But if you bathe regularly, you shouldn’t need them, according to Downie. “My patients are constantly asking me what I think about these products,” Downie said. “I tell them that I still like soap and water in the shower.”"
California child is presumed positive for bird flu,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/health/california-child-bird-flu/index.html,"A child in San Francisco who had red eyes and a fever had a probable case of H5N1 bird flu, according to the city’s Department of Public Health. The case was caught by routine surveillance. When the child developed symptoms, they were checked for RSV, Covid-19 and the flu, and they tested positive for influenza A. Across the US, labs are sequencing all influenza A viruses to learn their subtypes. This enhanced testing is a safeguard to ensure that H5N1 is not spreading widely in humans. Sequencing of the child’s sample determined that it was H5N1, and the sample will now go to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation. The child did not need to be hospitalized, and they have recovered from their illness. Disease detectives don’t know how the child was exposed to the virus. They say there’s no evidence that the infection spread to anyone else, and the risk to the general public remains low. There have been 66 other human cases of bird flu reported in the US in an ongoing outbreak in wild animals, poultry and dairy cows, according to the CDC. In December, a child in California tested positive for influenza A after drinking raw milk. They developed a fever and vomiting, but they recovered safely, and the infection was not confirmed to be H5 flu. As bird flu continues to spread among dairy cows, officials recommend that people avoid drinking raw milk or eating products made from raw milk, like cheese. Health officials also urge everyone to avoid direct contact with sick or dead birds, especially wild birds and poultry. Wild birds can be infected even if they don’t look sick. Symptoms of bird flu in humans may include red, inflamed eyes, fatigue, fever and headaches. Anyone who develops these symptoms after exposure to sick or dead birds is urged to contact a health care provider."
Avian Flu Fast Facts,https://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/23/health/avian-flu-fast-facts/index.html,"Here’s a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds. There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called “Influenza A (H5N1),” or the “H5N1 virus.” Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu. See also CDC’s Guidance on Prevention and Treatment. As of May 17, 2024, the mortality rate is close to 50% for infected humans.

"Sniffling, sneezing, coughing: What infectious disease do you have?",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/health/which-infectious-disease-wellness/index.html,"Welcome to winter virus season. Cases of acute respiratory illness, Covid-19 and seasonal flu are increasing in most parts of the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Emergency department visits for flu and the respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, are very high. Although Covid-19 cases leading to emergency department visits are still low, they are increasing, with wastewater testing already revealing high coronavirus levels. Against this backdrop, norovirus cases causing gastrointestinal upset also have been surging. Several other infectious illnesses are making the rounds too, including the viruses that cause the common cold and bacteria that lead to strep throat. How can you know which infectious disease you have? Does it depend on the illness, the symptoms or the characteristics of the person who is ill? And how can people find out what to do: Should they go to their primary care provider, urgent care or the hospital’s emergency department? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner. CNN: How should people who are sick decide when they need testing to figure out what illness they have? Dr. Leana Wen: I would approach this question by thinking about whether what you would do for yourself or your sick loved one would change if you knew the specific pathogen. Your actions would depend on the pathogen in question and the person’s age, underlying medical conditions and type of symptoms. Let’s begin with respiratory illnesses. Most healthy people who have mild symptoms like runny nose, congestion and fatigue do not need to seek medical care. More than 200 viruses cause the common cold, which is more than likely the cause of these symptoms. Even if these healthy individuals with mild symptoms have Covid-19 or influenza, they probably wouldn’t be eligible for antiviral treatment. They could choose to take home tests for Covid-19, influenza or both if they want to know if they have these two viruses, but this knowledge wouldn’t really change their clinical management. The recommendation would be symptomatic treatment, meaning rest, lots of fluids and over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen and ibuprofen to relieve symptoms of fever and body aches. Testing remains important for some people though. Individuals at higher risk for developing severe disease from Covid-19 and influenza should get tested as soon as their symptoms start so that they can begin prompt antiviral treatment. People at higher risk for severe disease from Covid-19 include older individuals and those with chronic underlying medical problems. These are also individuals at higher risk of serious outcomes due to influenza. For instance, pregnant women are considered especially vulnerable to complications of the flu. Severity of illness also plays a role for two reasons. In the case of flu, antiviral treatment is recommended for those people who are very sick with influenza, even if they don’t have risk factors for severe illness. In addition, if someone is very ill, they could have another disease. Perhaps what they have isn’t a simple cold but rather a bacterial pneumonia requiring antibiotics. Or maybe they started with a cold, but then they developed pneumonia. Someone who has worsening cough, persistent high fevers and other concerning symptoms like chest pain, abdominal pain and trouble catching their breath needs to seek medical care to treat these symptoms and to seek the underlying cause. If symptoms are not improving after five to seven days, it would also be reasonable to contact your health care provider. CNN: What about people with other symptoms, such as stomach upset? Do they need testing? Wen: The majority of people with diarrhea, vomiting and stomach cramps have viral gastroenteritis caused by the very contagious norovirus. This illness comes on abruptly and is very uncomfortable, but the vast majority recover fully within a few days. No specific treatment exists, and generally testing is not recommended to confirm the diagnosis. There are exceptions. If someone has persistent symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting, if they develop fevers, if they have severe abdominal pain, the concern is that what they have isn’t run-of-the-mill norovirus. Maybe they have a bacterial infection and need antibiotics. Maybe what they have isn’t an infection at all and could be appendicitis. They should consult with a doctor to see if additional evaluation and testing is needed. Severity of illness, especially in vulnerable individuals, is another red flag. Babies and other young children, as well as the elderly and people with chronic kidney and heart problems, need to visit the doctor sooner rather than later to make sure they are keeping hydrated. CNN: What other symptoms should people look out for when it comes to whether they need testing? Wen: If your kid has a sore throat and fever, seek care to see if they have strep throat. They will need antibiotics to prevent complications that come with the group A streptococcal bacteria that causes strep throat. Many cases of sore throat are due to viruses and do not need specific treatment, so it’s important to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of sore throat. Clinicians can sometimes also distinguish between them based on symptoms, though sometimes a strep test is done. CNN: How should people think about when they go to which setting — primary care provider versus urgent care versus the emergency department? Wen: I would think about three factors here. First, if you have a primary care provider, what access do you have? Some people can reach their physician or another clinician in the same practice 24/7. That’s terrific, and in most circumstances, it’s worth calling that person to seek their counsel on next steps. Perhaps they could even do a same-day appointment in person or virtually. When possible, it’s always best to see the provider who knows you and your medical history. If you cannot easily reach your provider or don’t have one, you will have to set a lower bar for going to an urgent care or emergency department setting. I encourage everyone to have a plan before getting ill. Know what your insurance covers and how crowded the settings may be. It’s possible that an urgent care visit is significantly cheaper than the emergency department, and the wait is likely shorter. Second, how severe is the illness? If someone is experiencing very concerning symptoms, like chest pain, trouble breathing, numbness or weakness in an arm or leg, they should go to the emergency department right away. On the other hand, someone who isn’t feeling well but their symptoms have been going on for some time can call their primary care office for next steps. If they cannot easily reach the provider and don’t want to wait, they can go to an urgent care facility. Third, are you in a group of individuals considered to be especially vulnerable? Babies, pregnant women, older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions face additional risks of severe illness. Patients and families should have a plan. For instance, pregnant women should know if their first call is to their obstetrician and where they can access care. Parents of newborns and young babies should also know how to reach their pediatrician. In an emergency, they need to know which specific place they should go to, since not all urgent care or emergency departments have specialists trained to treat babies. And individuals with specific conditions, such as cancer patients on chemotherapy or people who have received an organ transplant, need to be especially on guard and know where they can access medical assistance tailored to them. CNN: What are some preventive measures that people can take to reduce their risk of catching and transmitting infectious diseases? Wen: It’s not easy to avoid infections during winter virus season, but people can take steps. Everyone should wash their hands regularly with soap and water, and, if soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer. People who are especially vulnerable to severe illness should consider limiting their interactions with others. They should consider wearing a high-quality mask in indoor, crowded settings, and they should ask family members and friends who have symptoms to stay away until symptoms resolve."
Forget crunches: The smarter way to strengthen your core,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/health/core-strength-wellness/index.html,"If you’re like most people, when you hear the word core, you probably think of six-pack abs. But your core is so much more than that — it’s the powerhouse that stabilizes, supports and moves you through life. Despite its central role in your body’s physical function, the core is often misunderstood and poorly targeted in workouts. Many people focus on achieving a sculpted appearance while neglecting other critical aspects such as mobility and stability. A truly healthy core is about function — not just form — supporting your body in accomplishing both daily tasks and athletic feats. Whether you want better balance, more powerful movements, or fewer backaches and injuries in the new year or any time of year, your core holds the key. Read on to learn why core health matters and how to train your core effectively. Your core is an interconnected group of muscles that includes all your abs — not just your rectus abdominis, the long vertical muscle that can appear as a visible six-pack in people with low body fat. And because your core wraps around the entire midsection of your body, it also includes your side waist, pelvic floor and lower back muscles as well as your diaphragm, your primary respiratory muscle that runs from your rib cage to your lumbar spine. Together, these muscles form a fundamental support system, enabling nearly every move you make and every breath you take. As a mobility coach in professional sports, I’ve seen firsthand how core integration is essential for nearly every physical action. Your core isn’t just along for the ride — it’s the driver, ensuring strength, stability and efficiency in movement. Whether you’re walking, lifting or playing a sport, your core plays a pivotal role in your body’s key functions. Here’s how: Stabilization and balance: Your core stabilizes your spine and pelvis and influences rib cage position, creating a foundation for posture and movement. This stability is crucial not only for athletic performance but also for ensuring the ability to maintain neutral posture and balance to prevent injuries. For example, standing on one leg or walking on an uneven surface both rely on your core to keep you upright and stable. Movement in all directions: While stability is crucial, your core also needs to be mobile. Imagine twisting to grab something from your car’s back seat or reaching into your grocery cart to place items on the checkout conveyor belt — both movements require core mobility. A stiff or inflexible core can limit your range of motion and increase your risk of injury. I see this limitation lead to injury all too often in rotational athletes when they focus too much on anterior core strengthening and not enough on mobilization. Power transmission: Whether you’re throwing a football, swinging a golf club or sprinting, your core allows for the efficient expression of power through your limbs. Without a stable core, this power transfer is less effective, putting more stress on your joints, which can lead to compensation and overuse injuries, especially for athletes. In my experience, this is a common cause for tennis elbow. Crunches have a long-standing history as the gold standard of ab exercises. But, unlike crunches, which isolate your rectus abdominis, planks activate your entire core, from your deep stabilizing muscles to your obliques and lower back. Important note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. 1. Start on your hands and knees with your wrists aligned under your shoulders.Gaze slightly ahead of your hands to keep your neck in a neutral position. 2. Step your feet back one at a time, straightening your legs to create a diagonal line from your head to your hips and down to your heels. 3. Engage your core by exhaling and moving your ribs back and down toward your waist. Avoid letting your hips sag or back arch. 4. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds to start, maintaining a deep, even breathing pattern. Rest for 10 to 15 seconds in between reps and repeat two to three times. Gradually increase the duration of holds as your strength improves. If a traditional straight-arm plank is too taxing on your wrists or shoulders, modify with a forearm plank by putting your forearms down with your elbows aligned under your shoulders. Likewise, if having your legs straight is too difficult, drop down to your knees. Almost every exercise imaginable requires core activation to be safe and effective, but the plank stands out as a foundational core exercise because it not only enables full core muscle activation but also provides a base for variation to increase emphasis on specific areas and benefits. Adding dynamic movements — such as shoulder taps or mountain climbers — emphasizes integrated strength and mobility, while variations, such as a side plank, target your obliques and challenge your balance. One of my favorite side plank dynamic progressions is adding a reach-and-rotate movement, which covers the bases of stability, mobility and strength. To perform this, from a side plank, reach your top arm under your body as if threading a needle, then rotate it back upward toward the ceiling. No matter what variants of plank you choose or other core-focused exercises, always round out your core training with mobility exercises that rotate and stretch your core in all directions. You can easily accomplish this with some basic yoga twists and bends. A well-functioning core is not just for athletes. It’s essential for everyone. But building a healthy core does not mean spending hours in the gym. You can build a stronger, more resilient core with a few minutes of targeted exercises a few times a week. By practicing a mix of static holds, dynamic exercises and rotational movements, such as those mentioned above, over time, you will notice improvements not just in your core strength, but in how you move, perform and feel in everyday life."
Walking just 5 minutes a day makes a difference,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/health/walking-fitness-new-years-resolutions-wellness/index.html,"With the start of the new year, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by unrealistic goals and fitness trends. But you don’t need to follow those fads. Research shows that even a short amount of walking — one of the most accessible forms of exercise — can help set you up for success when working toward other fitness achievements. Research shows that 11 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per day may lower your risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease or premature death. Does that sound like too much to start? Even as little as five minutes of walking per day could provide some health benefits, according to Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. Freeman recommends aiming for 30 minutes of daily exercise, ideally brisk walking paired with weightlifting to create a high-intensity training program. But he said he knows that a structured workout of that length isn’t always feasible, especially for those in the early stages of their fitness journey. The key is to make movement a regular part of your day, which is why Freeman suggests people engage in any form of exercise, even if it’s incorporating a five-minute walk into your routine. Katy Milkman, James G. Dinan Professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, explains that making bite-size goals is essential for creating momentum for larger resolutions. Psychologically, smaller tasks are easier to achieve, so pushing yourself to take a five-minute daily walk is easier than trying to complete a 35-minute walk once, Milkman said. Even with a five-minute walk, the most important part of any fitness goal, according to Freeman, is finding time to weave it into your daily routine, which is why it’s important to start small and focus on simplicity. For some, doing so might be as basic as parking farther away when heading to the gym or mall to increase your step count. If you’re in a parking garage, it can also be a good idea to take the stairs to increase your heart rate, Freeman said. When making plans, CNN fitness contributor Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, suggests asking friends to go for a walk instead of meeting for dinner or drinks. Freeman also recommends completing your quick walk — or whatever form of exercise brings you joy — first thing in the morning to start your day with positive movement. And for coffee lovers, Freeman said a walk can energize you just as effectively as one cup of your favorite brew. When it comes to forming a new routine, it’s important not to make excuses, especially when trying to get steps in during the winter months. “Most malls open their doors early (before the actual stores open) to let walkers get their steps in by doing laps around the interior levels of the mall,” Santas said via email. Walking isn’t just good for your body; it’s also great for your mental well-being. Not only can it help break addictions such as smoking, Freeman said, but a walk can also help reduce anxiety and depression, especially for people who might be dealing with grief. While the holiday season is over, walking is also a good way to decompress from family gatherings and celebration stressors. As confidence in your walking routine grows, you should aim to increase the intensity and length of your workout. Freeman suggests focusing on exercises that make you “huff and puff” for the most noticeable health benefits. “You see these people (at the gym) do a couple of reps, chat, take a rest and have a drink,” Freeman said. “You really want to keep going for 20 or 30 minutes straight.” Combining weight training and cardio is a beneficial way to include both elements in your daily routine. Based on how the activities work different parts of your body, Freeman said he likes to explain cardio as a short-term investment in your health, while weight training is a long-term one because of how metabolically active people’s muscles are. To include weight training on your walk, Freeman recommends eventually adding a weighted backpack to your routine. If you want to keep it simple, use any backpack you have at home, and fill it with old books to load it down. Other ideas might include wearing wrist, arm, shoulder, ankle or leg weights to create resistance for an additional challenge. “If (people) can keep this (routine) up for usually two to three weeks, it becomes a habit (they) want to keep doing,” Freeman said. Like any other form of exercise, taking the time to practice and perfect your walking form can improve the safety and efficacy of your workouts, according to Santas, and it’s a simple way to challenge yourself. For people who want to incorporate longer walks into their daily or weekly routine, Freeman recommends walking with others to make the experience more enjoyable. If you don’t have people in your corner to join you, programs such as Walk With a Doc offer free community walks guided by physicians to create a casual and supportive environment for people to work on their healthy habits together. Solo exercisers might find personal motivation with an engaging podcast or audiobook as well as a guided meditation to make their walks feel effortless. “If you get really into a story … you could probably walk an entire park, end up right where you started, and not even know you did it,” Freeman said. It’s important to remember that the smaller the commitment, the more likely you are to follow through, Milkman said. As you add more to your routine, start slow and think about where you might be able to squeeze some quick yet beneficial movements into your practice. For those just starting to incorporate more exercise into their routine, it’s all about sitting less and moving more. Some workouts can even be completed from the comfort of your couch while watching an episode of your favorite TV show, Santas said via email. Are you ready to do more?

The next leg of the new moon race is about to kick off — and it could be the most exciting yet,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/science/lunar-landers-moon-missions-2025/index.html,"The past few years have marked the advent of a new lunar space race, with a fleet of robotic spacecraft from various countries trying — and mostly failing — to reach the moon and carry out their intended missions. But 2025 may offer a second chance for the companies and countries behind those missions that crashed and burned, as well as introduce some new players to the field. January will kick off with the launch of two lunar landers in one fell swoop: A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will carry spacecraft developed by Cedar Park, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and Tokyo-based Ispace. Firefly is making its first attempt to put a vehicle on the moon, but this mission marks a second try for Ispace, after its first lander crashed and blasted a divot in the lunar surface in 2023. And those two landers are only a couple of the uncrewed missions looking to reach the lunar surface — or seek redemption — in the coming months. This year promises to be among the most tantalizing yet in humanity’s renewed push to explore the moon, with the United States and its allies as well as China scrambling to send robots to the lunar surface. Many of these machine-driven missions are designed to pave the way for astronauts to return to the lunar surface, as NASA plans to do as soon as 2027. Here’s a glance at some of the moon shots on the horizon. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket slated to launch landers for both Firefly and Ispace is set to liftoff as soon as 1:11 a.m. ET Wednesday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. If all goes according to plan, Firefly’s lander, called Blue Ghost, will spend about 45 days making a careful approach to its lunar destination around Mons Latreille, an ancient volcanic feature in a more than 300-mile-wide (483-kilometer) basin called Mare Crisium, or the “Sea of Crises,” on the moon’s near side. “Mare Crisium was created by early volcanic eruptions and flooded with basaltic lava more than 3 billion years ago,” according to Firefly. “This unique landing site will allow our payload partners to gather critical data about the Moon’s regolith (rock and dust rubble), geophysical characteristics, and the interaction of solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field.” On board Blue Ghost will be a group of science experiments and technology demonstrations, including ones that will test a “Lunar PlanetVac” to collect and sort soil samples on the moon, satellite navigation, radiation-adapated computers, and self-cleaning glass that can wipe away lunar dust, according to Firefly. For its inaugural mission, Blue Ghost is expected to operate on the moon for about 14 days before its landing zone is plunged into the frigid temperatures of lunar nighttime. Firefly is among the participants in NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program in which the space agency partners with private companies to deliver payloads to the moon. Others contractors include Houston-based Intuitive Machines and Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology. The goal of the CLPS program is to give NASA a pool of commercial robotic landers that can ferry cargo to the lunar surface as the space agency works on separate plans to get its astronauts to the moon later this decade. “It’s a good time for the lunar economy,” Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CNN in December, adding that he’s “100% confident in our team’s ability” to land the company’s Blue Ghost vehicle successfully. Success, of course, is not guaranteed. Ispace, the Japan-based company, understands that all too well: The company’s first attempt to put one of its Hakuto-R landers on the moon ended in a dramatic failure in April 2023 because of navigation issues. Now, an upgraded Hakuto-R spacecraft, named Resilience, will offer Ispace a second chance. The spacecraft will take a much slower path to the moon than Blue Ghost after the landers are deployed from their Falcon 9 rocket. Resilience is aiming to land on the moon roughly four to five months after liftoff, according to Jumpei Nozaki, the Ispace’s chief financial officer. On this mission, the Resillience lander will carry a tiny rover as well as tech instruments with various goals, including testing algae-based food production and monitoring deep-space radiation. Ispace is targeting an area of the moon called Mare Frigoris — or the “Sea of Cold,” which lies in the far northern reaches of the moon’s near side — for its landing location. Houston-based Intuitive Machines made history in February 2024 by putting a US-made lunar lander on the moon for the first time in more than five decades. The triumphant touchdown of the company’s Nova-C lunar lander, called Odysseus, spurred jubilant cheers during the company’s webcast. But the landing wasn’t perfect: Odysseus tipped over on its side because of a navigation issue, leaving the vehicle to run with limited power and capabilities. But Intuitive Machines will soon get another shot at perfection with a new Nova-C lander, called Athena, set to make its way moonward this year. The mission, slated to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, could kick off as soon as late February, the company confirmed Monday. It will aim to land near the moon’s south pole — a region considered crucial to the current moon race because it’s believed to be home to stores of water ice. Water found there could be used to provide astronauts with drinking water or even converted to rocket fuel. Notably, on board Athena will be PRIME-1, or the Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment 1, a NASA-developed tech demo designed to search and drill for water ice. Also sharing a ride with Athena will be NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer, a satellite designed to orbit the moon and use remote sensing to detect water. If both of those NASA payloads succeed, it will be a welcome win for the space agency, which lost at least four research satellites during its November 2022 Artemis I mission. The primary goal of that flight — to send an unoccupied crew capsule on a test flight around the moon — went smoothly. But a group of small NASA satellites deployed alongside the spacecraft, including two meant to hunt for lunar water, failed to hit their marks. Blue Origin, the space company Jeff Bezos founded in 2000, may also debut a prototype of its lunar lander. The spacecraft, called Blue Moon, is one of two vehicles NASA has picked to potentially ferry astronauts from lunar orbit down to the surface of the moon. Blue Origin’s contract for that task is worth $3.4 billion. (The other vehicle NASA selected is SpaceX’s Starship, which will aim to carry out the first landing in 2027.) A Blue Moon vehicle capable of carrying humans is likely at least a few years away from its debut, but Blue Origin plans to launch a “pathfinder” lander for cargo missions to the moon as soon as this year. It’s not clear exactly when, however, or if that timeline will stick. The mission will send a robotic lander to test Blue Moon’s design and engine capabilities, aiming to ensure a smooth ride for future missions with valuable science payloads or crew on board. NASA will also put one science instrument on board called Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume Surface Studies, or SCALPSS, which is a set of cameras designed to monitor how moon dust reacts to the engines of landers as they head in for touchdown. Blue Origin’s pathfinder spacecraft is slated to launch atop one of the company’s New Glenn rockets, which was set to make its debut flight Monday morning. But Blue Origin aborted the inaugural launch attempt as engineers worked to troubleshoot an undisclosed issue with the rocket. More moon missions are on the docket for later this year, though the complexity of such endeavors routinely leads to delays. That said, Intuitive Machines could launch its third robotic lunar mission, called IM-3, as soon as October. Astrobotic Technology may also get a chance to bounce back from a disappointing first go at a moon landing in 2024. Its Peregrine lander began leaking fuel after reaching space last January, forcing the vehicle to swing back toward Earth and abandon its lunar ambitions. The company has a new, larger vehicle — called Griffin — in the works for a launch as soon as this year. However, Astrobotic has already hit several complications with Griffin, including NASA’s cancellation of a rover meant to fly on board the lunar lander. That rover, called the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, remains in limbo. But Astrobotic has said it may outfit Griffin with some of the company’s own technology, such as infrastructure for its planned lunar power business called LunaGrid. Finally, according to a timeline laid out in early 2024, SpaceX may attempt to send an uncrewed Starship spacecraft — the most powerful launch vehicle ever made — to the moon. It’s not clear if that mission will actually happen in 2025. When reached for comment, a NASA spokesperson confirmed in an emailed statement that conducting an uncrewed test mission to the moon is part of the space agency’s development requirements for SpaceX’s Starship — but the statement did not say whether the rocket may be ready for such a demo this year. “NASA continues to work closely with SpaceX on progress toward milestones, including a design review, individual subsystem development and testing, and SpaceX’s integrated flight test campaign,” the space agency said. “Please refer to SpaceX for more information on their development progress.” SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment nor does the company typically respond to routine inquiries from reporters. Officials at NASA, however, have more recently indicated that SpaceX at least plans to ramp up Starship development this year, completing missions that will show how the spacecraft can be refueled once in orbit. (Starship is expected to need its propellant topped off multiple times as it sits in Earth orbit before it can complete a moon mission.) Whether all these missions squeeze onto the 2025 calendar remains to be seen. What’s certain, however, is that NASA, the commercial space sector, and nations around the globe are fomenting their desires to renew lunar exploration. NASA, for example, wants more than just to return American astronauts to the lunar surface: The federal agency is seeking to establish a permanent settlement there, angling to compete with the ambitions of China, which is aiming to put boots on the moon by 2030. The pursuits by the US and China are in part nationalistic and political. But the objectives are also scientific. “From a scientific perspective, if we think about it, the moon is a repository of information of what’s been happening to both the moon and Earth over time,” said Dr. Bethany Ehlmann, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology and the principal investigator for NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer orbiter. “So a big question is, where did this water on the moon come from? Is it ancient? And then, what does that tell us about how the Earth got water?”"
Blue Origin stands down from New Glenn launch attempt — again,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/science/new-glenn-blue-origin-rocket-launch-attempt/index.html,"Blue Origin, the rocket company founded by Jeff Bezos in 2000, has called off a second attempt to launch its 30-story New Glenn rocket. The vehicle had been slated to get off the ground early Monday, but the company waved off that plan so engineers could work to address a technical issue with the vehicle. By Monday evening, after roughly 16 hours with no update and no word on what exactly that problem was — Blue Origin took to social media to declare it could make a second attempt during a three-hour launch window that opens at 1 a.m. ET Tuesday. Just a couple of hours later, however, Blue Origin revealed it would not try for the overnight liftoff after all. “We’re moving our NG-1 launch to no earlier than Thursday, January 16,” the company said in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. That day, Blue Origin will have the same three-hour, early-morning launch window from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. ET. The company did not immediately say why it reversed course on plans to attempt a New Glenn launch Tuesday morning. But Blue Origin had cautioned earlier that unfavorable weather conditions at the takeoff site may lead to another scrub. “Tonight’s poor weather forecast at LC-36 could result in missing this window,” the company said in a Monday evening post. In the dispatch, Blue Origin also disclosed more detail on the problem engineers had sought to fix during the last attempt. “This morning’s scrub was due to ice forming in a purge line on an auxiliary power unit that powers some of our hydraulic systems,” the company said. A “purge line” is a pipe or tube that can be used to flush out any unwanted gases or debris from a rocket system. That detail was more than Blue Origin offered during its webcast of Monday’s launch attempt. At the time, the company revealed only that engineers were grappling with “anomalies,” which is aerospace parlance for issues with the rocket that must be fixed before giving the final green light for takeoff. “We are standing down from today’s launch attempt to troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue” said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin’s vice president of in-space systems. At one point Monday morning, the countdown clock crept down to show less than 10 minutes before liftoff, but Blue Origin periodically added more time as engineers worked to troubleshoot outstanding issues. Ultimately, the problems were not resolved with ample time before the launch window was set to close at 4 a.m. ET. A smooth inaugural liftoff for New Glenn could be crucial, as the company is hoping to gather copious data from this flight and pave the way for the rocket to quickly make an impact on the global launch industry. New Glenn is the first rocket developed by Blue Origin that aims to be capable of sending satellites to orbit — a feat that will be necessary for any company hoping to challenge SpaceX’s long-held dominance in the launch market. Blue Origin waved off the New Glenn launch heading into a busy week for spaceflight. Notably, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying two lunar landers is set to take off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center — which lies adjacent to Cape Canaveral — as soon as Wednesday at 1:11 a.m. ET. SpaceX is also due to kick off the seventh test flight of its gargantuan Starship rocket on Wednesday."
Moon rover-inspired robot could be a game-changer for Japan’s aging farmers,https://edition.cnn.com/science/japan-robot-farming-kisui-adam-spc/index.html,"Japan’s population is the oldest in the world, with a third aged over 65, and one in 10 aged over 80, due to a combination of low fertility rates and high life expectancy. This has a direct effect on its working-age population — the share of 15 to 64 year-olds — which is projected to shrink by 30 million people between 2020 and 2070. Agriculture is particularly hit by the problem: according to Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the number of people mainly employed in farming halved between 2000 and 2023, and those aged under 60 only make up about 20% of the total. To combat this shortage, along with a more relaxed stance on immigration and fertility policies, the country is increasingly looking at robotics to supplement the workforce. Tamir Blum founded Kisui Tech while still a student, in 2021 — a company that is using technology from space exploration to build an AI-assisted farming robot. “In the past 20 years or so, 50% of the farmers have retired, meaning that there’s more and more burden on fewer and fewer farmers to keep producing a stable food supply,” he says. The semi-autonomous robot is called Adam and is able to carry picked produce across difficult terrain as well as cut grass and spray fields with pesticides. Blum, an Israeli-American who first visited Japan in 2015, returned to the country in 2018 for a PhD during which he researched lunar rovers and their ability to navigate bumpy and uneven terrain. “During that PhD program, I traveled a lot around the Japanese countryside,” he says, “You can tell how much difficulty (it) is having with the labor shortage. You see many abandoned houses … The farmers are clearly getting older … I realized how difficult it was, and also the great potential for this type of off-road robotics technology to be applied, especially for outdoor orchards, which are also very, very bumpy — similar to what I was researching for space robotics.” Kisui Tech is working with the Agriculture Department at Chiba University, near Tokyo, in developing two models of Adam — a full-size and a mini version — and testing them in real-life scenarios on farms around Japan. The larger Adam is 70 centimeters high and 188 centimeters in length, and is aimed primarily at apple and pear farmers, with a large truckbed to carry produce or fertilizer. The smaller Adam, about one third of the size, is targeting grape and persimmon farms, which are planted in narrower rows. Alongside the robots, Kisui is also developing an online platform called Newton, which gives farmers real-time insights into crops, diseases, and farm management. Adam is expected to retail for around $20,000 on international markets. “I’ve been really amazed by the reaction of the farmers,” says Blum, “because in Japan, I think most people would have a stereotype that farmers are very traditional: they don’t like technology, they’re not willing to try new things. However … they’ve been very receptive, very willing to give advice, very willing to try Adam.” Adam is approaching commercial release and has been radically transformed from early versions based on feedback from the farmers. For example, a touchscreen was replaced by a panel with physical buttons, because farmers often wear gloves, which don’t work well with touchscreens. Kisui recently completed its first paid proof of concept to automate patrol and data collection at a solar plant for a Japanese power company. Blum says it has also received requests from the construction industry, looking to use the robot for patrols, security and transporting heavy goods. “We see Adam as a tool, not just for farming, but basically all outdoor work,” says Blum."
See the full wolf moon overtake Mars in the night sky and glimpse a planetary parade,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/science/full-moon-mars-bright-planets/index.html,"Keep an eye on the sky Monday evening to see the wolf moon, the first full moon of the year. And some sky-gazers will be able to glimpse a cosmic magic trick when the moon appears to pass in front of Mars. The full moon will be at peak illumination at 5:27 p.m. ET Monday but will appear full into Wednesday morning, according to NASA. Viewers in most of the continental United States, eastern Canada, and parts of Africa and Mexico can look for a celestial triangle in the sky when evening twilight ends at 6:11 p.m. ET. Mars will appear just to the lower left of the moon, while the bright star Pollux will be a few degrees to the upper left of the moon, according to NASA. Times for the moon passing in front of Mars will vary, so be sure to check your favorite sky-watching app. For those on the US East Coast, Mars will disappear behind the bottom of the moon around 9:16 p.m. ET and reappear behind the upper right of the moon at 10:31 p.m. ET. January’s full moon is commonly called the wolf moon because wolves are active this time of year and can be heard howling on cold winter nights, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. The origin of the name stems from the Sioux language, which describes this moon as “wolves run together.” But this wintry full moon also goes by other monikers. It’s known as the cold moon to the Cherokee people, the hard moon to the Lakota and the whirling wind moon to the Passamaquoddy tribe. European names also include the ice moon, the old moon or the moon after Yule, originally a three to 12-day festival that occurred in pre-Christian Europe near the winter solstice, according to NASA. January’s full moon also ties in with the beginning of the Hindu pilgrimage and 44-day festival of Prayag Kumbh Mela, held every 12 years in the Indian city of Prayagraj. The full moon will be visible around the world, weather permitting. If you’re in the Northern Hemisphere, bundle up to stay warm and enjoy the view. After Mars does its disappearing trick behind the moon, look for the red planet to appear at its closest and brightest on Wednesday. During January, Mars is at opposition, meaning it’s directly opposite the sun from the vantage point of Earth. As the two planets travel along their orbital paths, Earth will be between Mars and the sun. The red planet will shine brightly each evening, according to NASA. Look for it in the east each night, as well as in the northwest at dawn. Mars isn’t the only planet to keep an eye out for this month. Sky-gazers can look forward to catching glimpses of four bright planets at the same time in the night sky. Venus and Saturn will appear in the southwest, Jupiter will gleam overhead, and Mars will appear to rise in the east. The planets will appear to rotate westward around the bright star Polaris and will be visible each night beginning early in the evening. Venus and Saturn will slowly appear to come close together in the night sky during what’s called the Venus and Saturn conjunction, although they are hundreds of millions of miles apart. The two planets will appear the nearest to one another on Friday and Saturday because of the positions of their orbits around the sun. Uranus and Neptune will be visible, too, albeit with the aid of binoculars or telescopes, according to EarthSky. While some may rush to call this parade a special alignment of the planets, there’s nothing unusual about it — although seeing four or five bright planets in the night sky at once is less common. Planets always appear along a line in the sky because they all orbit the sun in a mostly flat plane called the ecliptic. “Planets in our solar system, when they are visible, are always in a line because they follow the path of the sun — the ecliptic — across our sky. But they aren’t in a line stretching out, one behind another, from the sun, into 3-dimensional space,” according to EarthSky. So, enjoy the spectacle as bright planets appear to march across the night sky this month, and if you want to glimpse even more, set up a telescope and potentially spot moons around some of these neighboring worlds. Check out the following events occurring in our skies to add to your calendar. February 12: Snow moon March 14: Worm moon April 12: Pink moon May 12: Flower moon June 11: Strawberry moon July 10: Buck moon August 9: Sturgeon moon September 7: Corn moon October 6: Harvest moon November 5: Beaver moon December 4: Cold moon In 2025, there will be two partial solar eclipses. A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, but none of the celestial bodies is perfectly aligned, according to NASA.Unlike during a total solar eclipse, the moon only blocks part of the sun’s face, creating a crescent shape in which it appears the moon is taking a “bite” out of the sun. The first partial solar eclipse will happen on March 29, and it will be visible across parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and North and South America. The second partial solar eclipse will fall on September 21 and be visible over parts of Australia and Antarctica as well as some islands in the Pacific Ocean. There will also be two total lunar eclipses that occur during the March and September full moon events. A lunar eclipse, which causes the moon to look dark or dimmed, occurs when Earth is between the sun and moon and the three celestial objects line up in a row so that the moon passes into our planet’s shadow. When the moon is within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra, it takes on a reddish hue, which has led to the nickname “blood moon” for a lunar eclipse, according to NASA. That shadow isn’t perfect, so faint sunbeams sneak around the shadow’s edges on all sides in the colors of a sunset, bathing the moon in brilliant, warm hues. The first total lunar eclipse will be visible between March 13-14 and cross over Western Europe, parts of Asia, parts of Australia, western Africa, North and South America, and Antarctica. The second total lunar eclipse will occur on September 7-8 and be visible from Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of eastern South America, Alaska and Antarctica. Check Time and Date’s website to see when each of these eclipses will appear and the locations that will be able to view them. Here are peak dates for upcoming annual meteor showers, according to the American Meteor Society.

Sending a monthly postcard can help you practice gratitude,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/health/gratitude-monthly-postcard-wellness/index.html,"If you asked me what makes my heart sing, I’d immediately say words of affirmation. Few things bring me greater joy than hearing or reading heartfelt expressions of endearment from others. Sharing kind words is also one of the ways I show love to those around me, but I often feel by the year’s end that I haven’t expressed my admiration for others enough. While it’s wonderful to convey affection in person, it’s not always an option for me since I live far away from many of my family and friends. However, writing your feelings down offers a unique advantage — it gives the recipient a tangible, lasting reminder they can revisit when not in your presence. Personally, I treasure the idea of holding a physical sentiment that connects me to someone special in my life. That’s why I decided to start a new tradition this year: writing one postcard each month to someone special in my life. It’s going to be unrelated to their birthday or any holidays because I want to add an element of surprise. I think postcards will be a wonderful option for messages of gratitude because they feel less daunting than writing an entire letter. And isn’t it likely you already have a stash of postcards from previous trips that you haven’t found a purpose for yet? Incorporating gratitude into your routine is important because people crave recognition but can’t always provide it for themselves, according to Dr. Robert Emmons, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis. Although not everyone conveys gratitude in the same way, finding a practice that feels natural to you can positively impact your life and the lives of those around you, Emmons said. If you have trouble communicating thankfulness, writing a postcard might be a nice way to gently push yourself out of your comfort zone. Emmons explained that writing letters of gratitude can be more challenging than expressing appreciation in person because it may require people to elaborate on their feelings of vulnerability and self-disclosure instead of using generic statements that don’t hold significance or meaning. “A regular monthly practice such as (writing a postcard) is beneficial as it causes us to reflect on how we are supported and sustained by the kindness of others,” he said. People might be more expressive with their appreciation in postcards with phrases like “I am so thankful that you helped me out when I was in trouble …,” or “I’m grateful that you are in my life,” according to Emmons, which are more meaningful and descriptive than what might typically be used in face-to-face interactions. Sending gratitude in written form may also allow others to reflect on their own gratitude journey, Emmons said, because thankfulness is learned and practiced from those around you. It’s also likely that many people will cherish your letters and look back on your kind words frequently. “Gratitude is the moral cement, the all-purpose glue, the emotional spackle that squeezes into the cracks between people, strengthening and solidifying these relationships,” Emmons said. While postcards are a great way to initiate your gratitude practice this year, if you and the recipients don’t find joy in this exercise, you can try other simple ways to expand your gratitude. In lieu of or in addition to postcards, Emmons recommends that people practicing gratitude try to write letters to loved ones to go more in-depth about how the receiver has made an impact on their life. Increasing the frequency of sending gratitude notes is another option. Try challenging yourself by writing a letter weekly instead of monthly to increase the number of people you can reach and connect with throughout the year. For a more intimate experience, consider delivering your letter in person and reading your sincere words aloud to the recipient, Emmons said. Remember that sending a postcard or letter is a gift, and you should not expect the recipient to respond to your message, even if you’d like them to do so. You can extend an invitation for someone to reply, as long as you relay that there is no assumption for anything in return, Emmons said. He suggests a statement such as “I’d love to know what you’re up to and how you are doing since I last saw you” to encourage more back-and-forth communication. If you’re looking to join me in the search for showing more appreciation in the new year, dig around your place or head to the store for some postcards before brainstorming who might be the first person on your list to send some extra love.

FDA disappoints child advocates with its new limit on lead in baby food,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/06/health/lead-baby-food-fda-wellness/index.html,"For the first time in history, the US Food and Drug Administration has established guidance for levels of lead in processed baby foods that are sold on supermarket shelves and online. The agency’s action, announced Monday, only provides guidance to industry and is not enforceable. Under the new guidelines, baby food manufacturers should have no more than 10 parts per billion of lead in baby yogurts, custards, puddings, single-ingredient meats, processed fruits and vegetables, and mixtures of fruits, vegetables, grains and meat. “This includes foods in jars, pouches, tubs or boxes and may include ready-to-eat foods such as purees, as well as semi-prepared foods such as dry infant cereals,” the FDA said in a statement. However, root vegetables such as carrots and sweet potatoes — which typically contain the highest levels of lead from the soil — and dry infant cereals should contain no more than 20 parts per billion of lead, the FDA announced. “The guidance does not cover infant formula, beverages, or snack foods like puffs and teething biscuits,” the federal agency said. No level of lead is safe for infants and toddlers, according to the US Centers for Disease and Prevention, the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Parent should not throw away existing baby foods they have purchased or stop feeding young children a variety of foods, the FDA said. “Eating a variety of healthy foods can make it less likely for an individual to be exposed to the same contaminant from the same food many times and helps to provide the range of nutrients needed for health and, for children, healthy development. Having adequate nutrients stored in the body also can help to prevent lead from having harmful effects,” the agency said. “To get adequate food variety, the FDA recommends that parents and caregivers feed their children many different foods from the five food groups — vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, and protein foods — and alternate how often they provide the same food.” Gerber, which is owned by Nestlé SA and controls much of the US baby food market, told CNN that it has always worked closely with FDA regulators to reduce the levels of heavy metals in infants and young children. “All of our baby foods meet FDA limits for heavy metals, and we expect that will hold true for the new guidance,” Dana Stambaugh, director of external communications for Nestlé US, said in an email. “Ultimately, our promise is to provide nutritious and safe food for babies.” Another key player in the baby food market, Beech-Nut, told CNN the company was carefully reviewing the final guidance issued today. Organizations that prioritize children’s welfare were quick to react. “Nearly all baby foods on the market already comply with these limits, making the new standards largely ineffective,” said Jane Houlihan, the national director of science and health for Healthy Babies Bright Futures, a coalition of advocates committed to reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. Healthy Babies Bright Futures published a report in 2019 that found toxic metals in 95% of baby foods randomly pulled off supermarket shelves. The report sparked a congressional investigation that discovered some baby food ingredients contain hundreds of parts per billion of dangerous metals, according to internal documents provided by major baby food manufacturers. The baby food aisle accounts for only a fraction of children and toddler’s exposure to food sources of lead, Houlihan said, pointing to an analysis that Healthy Babies Bright Futures provided the FDA during public comments. “Lead in infant formula, homemade baby food ingredients and foods bought outside the baby food aisle account for about three-fourths of children’s food exposures to lead,” Houlihan said in an email. “As it stands, the new lead limits for commercial baby foods would reduce children’s total dietary lead exposure by less than 4% — a negligible improvement.” While applauding the FDA for acting on lead, it’s too little, too late, said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs for the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization. “For years, the FDA’s own data has shown dangerous levels of lead in baby food, yet the agency has dragged its feet while children’s developing brains were exposed to this neurotoxin,” Faber said in an email. “The harm is permanent, and the delay has put countless kids at unnecessary risk,” he added. “The FDA owes parents answers and must enforce these limits immediately to finally protect our most vulnerable population.” CNN reached out to the FDA for response but did not hear back before publication. As part of the volcanic process that created much of the continents, lead and other heavy metals occur naturally in Earth’s crust. However, manufacturing plants, mining facilities and smelting processes also add heavy metals to the environment as frequent by-products. Chips from lead-based paint, which was federally banned in 1978, and automobile exhaust fumes from leaded gasoline, which wasn’t banned until 1996, have also polluted soil and water in the US. It’s not just children who are at risk: There is no level of lead that’s safe for humans of any age, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Lead bioaccumulates in the body over time and is a “toxic metal” that can be harmful even at low exposure levels, the agency said. However, experts say children are especially hard-hit due to their small size and rapidly developing brains. “A dose of lead that would have little effect on an adult can have a significant effect on a child. In children, low levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood cells,” the EPA states on its website. The WHO considers lead one of the 10 chemicals of concern in the world. An October 2023 study published in the journal Lancet found children younger than 5 years lost 765 million IQ points in 2019 due to lead exposure worldwide. In the same year, more than 5.5 million adults died from cardiovascular disease due to lead exposure. “Exposure to very high levels of lead can severely damage the brain and central nervous system, causing coma, convulsions and even death. Children who survive severe lead poisoning may be left with permanent intellectual disability and behavioural disorders,” the WHO said on its website. The FDA first proposed the new lead levels in 2023 as part of its Closer to Zero initiative, which the agency says strives to lower the levels of arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury in baby foods. In 2021, the agency acted to lower limits of arsenic in infant rice cereals, a major route of exposure, according to experts. However, that action was also judged as inadequate to protect children. “The FDA should set protective targets for reducing exposure to heavy metals with a goal of having no measurable levels in children’s food,” Michael Hansen, senior scientist for Consumer Reports, which has studied levels of arsenic and other toxic metals in baby food, said at the time. Juice is another major exposure route of heavy metals in children. In 2022, the FDA proposed lowering the limits of lead in juices from 50 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion in apple juice and 20 parts per billion for all other juices. However, that draft guidance has never been finalized. “The FDA is not living up to its responsibility to protect children’s health,” Houlihan said. “As a result, infants and young children will continue to bear the burden of the FDA’s lack of resolve, consuming harmful lead with every meal.” The FDA has also not taken any action on levels of other heavy metals, such as cadmium, although that may change, Houlihan said. In September, the agency released an analysis that found “more than half of all children ages 1 to 6 exceed a safe daily dose for cadmium in food,” she said. According to that report, the main sources of exposure for children are grains, baked goods, fruits and vegetables. Processed baby foods contribute a tiny amount (0.5%) for that age group, Houlihan added."
Drinking sugary drinks may increase your risk of death. Here are alternative options,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/06/health/sugary-drinks-deaths-wellness/index.html,"Sugary drinks may leave a sour taste given their possible impact on mortality, according to a new study. “This is a public health crisis, requiring urgent action,” said the study’s senior author, Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, analyzed global data on sugar-sweetened beverages consumed around the world, observational and randomized studies, and both diabetes and cardiovascular disease prevalence. With the evidence, researchers created a comparative risk model and estimated that sugary drinks “cause more than 330,000 annual deaths from diabetes and cardiovascular disease,” Mozaffarian said. The problem is particularly serious in Latin America and the Caribbean, which had the largest number of cardiovascular disease cases related to beverages,  and sub-Saharan Africa, which also had the most cases of type 2 diabetes from sugary drinks, he added, based on the researchers’ model. The study also examined the demographics of those most affected by sweetened drinks –– namely, younger male adults with higher education in urban areas, said Toby Smithson, a registered dietitian nutritionist, fellow of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and senior manager of nutrition and wellness at the American Diabetes Association. She was not involved in the study. “It’s time to pay attention to, and take priority actions to deal with, this tragic preventable suffering,” Mozaffarian said in an email. Because the study did not test a behavior or intervention against a control group, the new study’s researchers can’t say that the sugar sweetened beverages are causing diabetes and cardiovascular disease –– they can only estimate the impact. The researchers collected valuable data across 184 countries, but the study did not factor in all income levels and the increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease among high-risk ethnic groups, Smithson said. But the finding of sugary beverages as harmful makes sense, as many studies have shown a link between such drinks and poor health impacts, Mozaffarian said. Sugar sweetened beverages have “empty calories” — or calories without any nutritional benefits, Smithson said.  They are also a source of fast-acting carbohydrates, which enter the bloodstream and raise blood sugar quickly, she added. These empty sugars in liquid form are even more harmful than those in desserts or sweet foods, Suzanne Janzi, a doctoral student in nutritional epidemiology at Lund University in Sweden, said in an earlier CNN article. She was not part of the most recent research. “Liquid sugars are absorbed more rapidly in the digestive system since they do not require the same breakdown processes as solid foods,” Janzi said in an email. “Solid sugars are often part of foods that contain other nutrients like fiber, proteins, and fats.” Those nutrients slow digestion, meaning there is a more gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream, she said. While fats, fiber and proteins in solid food leave you feeling fuller longer, liquid sugars often don’t fill you up, which can lead to appetite dysregulation and the consumption of too many calories, she added. “Different sources of added sugars also vary in their consumption patterns, which could further explain why they associate differently with cardiovascular disease risk,” Janzi said. What about drinks that are sweetened with something other than sugar? They might be better, but they aren’t the answer, Mozaffarian said. “Growing research shows that both natural and artificial low-calorie sweeteners are not innocuous and may cause health harms, so these should be considered a short-term, less harmful alternative, not a long-term solution,” he said. For example, artificial sweeteners might be a good substitute in moderation for people with diabetes, who may be accustomed to sugary drinks, Smithson said. “By providing a diabetes-friendly way to prepare foods people are used to eating, we can meet people where they are in offering support to effectively manage their diabetes,” she said. But instead of relying on artificial sweeteners, Mozaffarian advises switching to unsweetened drinks all together, such as seltzer, unsweetened tea or coffee, or just plain water. Hydration is important for managing blood pressure, blood sugar, internal temperature and digestion, Smithson said. “The best hydrating beverage is water,” she said in an email. “If a person doesn’t like plain water, they can jazz up their beverage by drinking infused water with slices of lemon, lime, or fresh herbs, or using sparkling waters that contain no added sugar.”"
An often overlooked way to improve your sex life in 2025,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/06/health/sex-sleep-wellness/index.html,"Sex just isn’t the same with your partner anymore. When you confide that sad reality to a friend, what’s the first culprit you discuss? Overwork? Young children? Relationship problems, or even the worst-case scenario — an affair? You may want to start by looking at your sleep habits as a couple, said Dr. Phyllis Zee, chief of sleep medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and director of its Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine in Chicago. “Don’t just toss it up to ‘My partner just isn’t interested,’ or ‘I’m too tired to care about sexual desire,’ or ‘Oh, I’m just getting old, that’s just the way it is,’” Zee said. “Look at yourself, look at your sleep habits and consider those of your partner as well.” Poor quality sleep is directly linked to inadequate levels of sex hormones, such as testosterone — and if you think that just applies to men, think again. “The sex drive in both men and women is testosterone-related — testosterone increases libido,” Zee said. “Testosterone begins to rise about 3 or 4 o’clock and peaks in the morning. And studies have shown that if you have disrupted sleep, those levels fall.” Women over 50 who slept fewer than seven to eight hours per night were less likely to report being sexually active than younger women, according to a 2017 Menopause Society study. It’s a problem that worsens with age as sleep becomes more precious. In fact, women older than 70 who slept fewer than five hours a night were 30% less likely to be sexually active than women sleeping seven to eight hours, that study found. A 2021 analysis of studies found men who were sleep-deprived had lower testosterone levels, while another study  found men with disturbed sleep had both lower testosterone levels and higher amounts of cortisol, the stress hormone. When sleep becomes a priority, however, sex lives can improve. A 2015 study of sleep and sex in college students found each additional hour of sleep was correlated to an improved libido, greater vaginal lubrication and a 14% increase in having sex the next day. “I think it is legitimate to say that one is too tired for sex,” said Ian Kerner, a licensed couples therapist in New York City who is a writer and CNN contributor on sex and relationships. But how we think of sex might require a change in perspective. “We also have to look at sex as less of a light switch that you turn on and off, and more as a dimmer that you really need to let simmer and then turn up to percolate sexual desire,” Kerner said. “It requires an attitudinal shift. I think you have to show up prepared to simmer, then percolate and let desire emerge, as opposed to it just happening.” Want more from your sex life? Get prepared to spice it up this year with a new perspective on sleep. We keep our bodies clean, washing skin and hair and brushing and flossing teeth. If we just rolled into and out of bed without doing any of those things at night and in the morning, we’d soon be a mess. The same applies to sleep, experts say. Just as you choose your clothes or style your hair, you need to prepare your body and bedroom for good sleep. Keep the bedroom cool and dark without blue light distractions such as televisions and smartphones. Avoid eating or drinking about three hours before retiring — especially alcohol, which will wake you in the middle of the night once it metabolizes. Try soothing music, yoga or meditation or consider a warm bath or shower to relax. And most importantly, Zee said, plan to disengage your mind. “Stop the work and prepare for relaxation,” Zee said. “Stop being engaged mentally about an hour before you go to bed so that you can be more relaxed and ready for sleep.” You’re also more likely to be relaxed enough for sex, which brings its own sleep benefits. “Sex is actually good for sleep,” Kerner said. “Sex itself is a process of getting into a flow state, getting into our bodies and turning off our anxious minds. Orgasms release hormones and neurotransmitters that promote sleep, so good sex nurtures sleep.” Sleep disorders can also interfere with sex, and millions of Americans have one or more, often undiagnosed. Obstructive sleep apnea — a potentially dangerous condition in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds or more at a time multiple times an hour — has been linked to erectile dysfunction in men and sexual disorders in women. While snoring is a common symptom of sleep apnea, so are night sweats, tooth grinding and morning headaches. All these can be warning signs that you should visit a sleep specialist. Insomnia, in which people wake during the night and have trouble getting back to sleep, is another sign of sleep apnea — as well as a sleep disorder on its own — and is linked to sexual issues in both men and women. Poor sleep also increases the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular problems in both sexes, limiting blood flow that may affect sexual function as well. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders, which present as an inability to sleep at the desired time to function optimally at work and school, can also wreak havoc with one’s sex life. Shift workers, who split their days and nights or work entirely overnight, often experience chronic sexual dysfunction — and that applies to both men and women. Mismatched sleep chronotypes — such as one partner who is a night owl and stays up late while the other is an early bird who’s in bed by 9 p.m. — can negatively affect a couple’s sex life. Studies show that couples who go to bed and get up together report greater sexual satisfaction and better sleep quality. “Be mindful of your partner’s chronotype,” Zee said, “and if you aren’t certain, there are chronotype questionnaires online that you both can take.” While your sleep chronotype is genetically programmed, there are ways you can adjust to match your partner’s preference. A night owl, for example, can turn off lights earlier to trigger the release of melatonin, nature’s sleep hormone, and flood their eyes with early morning light to turn it off. “The strongest reset for the circadian system is bright light,” Zee told CNN in an earlier interview. “Light in the morning changes the oscillation of your circadian clock genes at both a cellular and molecular level. You are also training all your rhythms, whether it’s sleep, blood pressure, heart rate or your cortisol rhythm to be earlier.” Eating evening meals at an earlier time also sends a message to the body to adjust its internal rhythm, as does moving one’s exercise routine to the morning or early afternoon. “I think exercise is really good for both sleep and sex,” Zee said. “It boosts muscle, limbers joints and can increase your libido.” All too often people expect to fall asleep when their head hits the pillow — or have their libido work at will — but that’s a pipe dream, Kerner said. “It’s really easy to develop bad sleep habits that can affect the quality of your sleep, and the same is true for sex,” he said. “A lot of people think sex is spontaneous, sex is organic, sexual chemistry and sexual fireworks should just happen,” Kerner said. “And that’s absolutely not true in long-term relationships. Good sex, just like good sleep, needs to be planned.” Kerner often gives couples he works with homework assignments that he calls “willingness windows.” “I ask them to carve out a window of time to be willing to be sexual with each other. It doesn’t have to result in sex. It can just be 15 minutes of kissing or fooling around, just trying to warm up and see where things go,” he said. “Any sexual contact reminds you and your partner that sex is part of your life, and it’s important. Any shared arousal, any flirtation, is a positive move toward future sexual events.” Do you want to learn more about sleep?

"One small thing can add years to your life, experts say",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/05/health/drinking-water-wellness/index.html,"What are you focusing on in the new year to improve your health? Regular exercise, of course, is a proven winner, as is eating plant-based meals. Getting more high-quality sleep, reducing stress, limiting alcohol and connecting with other people in meaningful ways are also key ways to boost well-being. However, there is one behavior change often overlooked when we think about improving our health in the new year: hydration. Water is the elixir of life, but few people make drinking enough a priority. Yet it’s so easy — there are no gyms to join, no meals to prepare, no need to scour the internet for a tasty mocktail — and experts say water’s benefits are almost too numerous to mention. Drinking plenty of water can improve blood pressure, diabetes, joint, gut and kidney health as well as ease migraines and boost the glow of your skin, among other benefits. “Staying optimally hydrated is a relatively easy lifestyle modification with potentially significant benefit: a longer disease-free life,” said Natalia Dmitrieva, a research scientist in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Regenerative Medicine at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. How can you add this one small thing to your daily life? Attach drinking a full glass of water to other key routines you do without thinking. Coffee or tea drinker? While you wait for your coffee to perk or your tea kettle to whistle, fill a glass with water (add ice if you prefer, like me) and drink it down while you wait. Taking the dog for a walk? Fill a stainless steel or ceramic water bottle (to avoid plastics of course) and drink it down before you return. Getting up to stretch? Grab a glass of water and drink it before you sit back down. Heating up a lunch? Drink a full glass of water during the time it takes your food to get hot. Experts on habit formation say that if you attach a new habit to an old one — called habit stacking — it’s easier to remember to accomplish the new task. And downing a refreshing glass of water while you wait is a healthy way to multitask. Statistics show Americans often fail to drink enough water, said Dmitrieva, who has studied the link between hydration and aging. Many experts suggest women drink about eight to 10 cups of water daily and men consume 10 to 12 cups, she said. “However, more than 50% of Americans do not meet these recommended levels,” Dmitrieva said via email. “One reason for this shortfall is that most people do not consciously consider how much water they need to drink and are often unaware of these recommendations.” Another key reason is that many drink only during meals or rely on a sensation of thirst to act. However, that’s much too late. “Thirst often occurs when we are already underhydrated, meaning the harmful effects of insufficient hydration may have already begun,” Dmitrieva said. Do you have to drink only water to meet your needs? No, says the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Plain coffee or tea, sparkling water, seltzers and flavored waters are low-calorie choices. However, regular sodas, fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened waters, and sweetened coffee and tea have no nutritional value and should be avoided. Some foods also contain water and can help with hydration: “Examples include tomatoes, cucumbers, oranges and lettuce, all of which can significantly contribute to your daily water intake,” Dmitrieva said. Ready for another tip? Aim to drink 2 to 3 quarts of water on regular days without intense physical activity or prolonged time in hot environments — you’ll need even more then, Dmitrieva said. “One effective strategy is to fill a 32-ounce bottle with water in the morning and make sure to drink it throughout the day, in addition to any other beverages consumed during meals or coffee breaks,” she said. “At the end of the day, assess whether you’ve consumed an additional 4-6 cups of water. If not, refill the bottle and drink more before the day ends.” Ready to do more to nourish your body? Sign up for our Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style newsletter.

"No apps, no hacks. A guide to optimizing productivity",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/03/health/productivity-tips-wellness/index.html,"I used to be a productivity app junkie. If an app promised to make me smarter, faster or more efficient, I downloaded it. Time trackers, digital planners, habit trackers — you name it. I spent hours setting them up, convinced this one would fix my time management problems. Spoiler alert: None of them did. After five years of working remotely in a demanding industry, launching major products and having a baby, I’ve learned the hard truth: No app can fix your focus. Productivity isn’t about software or someone else’s “perfect” routine. It’s about mindset — nailing the basics and figuring out what works for you. That’s where mindful productivity comes in. Mindful productivity isn’t about hustling from dawn till dusk or checking off 100 tasks just to collapse at the end of the day. It’s about knowing what you want to accomplish and working with intention toward those accomplishments — all while paying attention to what you’re doing and how you’re doing it. It’s staying focused on your goals and not being overwhelmed. For me, it shows up in the agenda I set the night before my next morning. It’s in the pause before I send a snarky email I’ll regret later. It’s the deep breath when I see my calendar looks like chaos and I realize, “This can wait.” Mindful productivity is about focusing on what matters so you can crush your work goals and have a life outside of them. In my case, it includes chasing a goofy, rambunctious 16-month-old around my home. The way I do it works for me with the life I have. At every stage, whether it was getting married, jumping into a new industry, working remotely and having a baby, I had to reevaluate my priorities and update my strategies. Tweak or overhaul these ideas so they work for you. If you’re game to try these hacks and forget apps in the new year, here’s how I do it: If you don’t protect your time, no one else will. That’s why I block focused work sessions and treat them as sacred. Mondays and Fridays are my deep workdays — three-hour blocks dedicated to high-priority projects with zero interruptions. Midweek, I squeeze in smaller blocks — an hour here, two hours there — to keep momentum on critical tasks. And remember it’s OK if your blocks look different. Not everyone can protect three hours of time. Fridays are my go-to day for recapping the week. I summarize progress, key wins and upcoming milestones tailored for teammates, customers and other stakeholders. This habit not only keeps my team aligned but also builds trust across the board. The key is to communicate and protect your time. I set an away message during these blocks, so my team knows exactly what I’m doing and why it matters. This results in no interruptions and no chaos — just focused, meaningful work. Here’s the bottom line: The way you treat your time is how others will treat it, too. When I have tried to work on more than one thing at a time, I accomplish less and get frustrated more often. That’s because multitasking isn’t possible, according to science. “Your brain is wired to do one thing at a time,” Dr. Aditi Nerurkar, an internal medicine physician and lecturer on global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School, told me. “When you multitask, what you are doing is ‘task switching,’ doing two separate tasks in rapid succession.” Task switching ironically weakens your productivity over time by affecting your prefrontal cortex, the area of your brain responsible for complex problem-solving, strategic thinking and organization. So Nerurkar, author of “The 5 Resets: Rewire Your Brain and Body for Less Stress and More Resilience,” advised me to “monotask instead to maintain your productivity while preserving your prefrontal cortex.” You know what you’ve done (or not done) by day’s end. I anchor the end of my day with a simple yet powerful ritual: I write down the three priorities I need to tackle for the next morning. Just three. This is my secret to ending the day on a high note. No lingering “What am I forgetting?” stress. No waking up to chaos. I leave a sticky note on my monitor, so when I sit down the next morning, I will know exactly where to start. On a recent Thursday morning, my sticky note read: Finalize a product requirements document, prep for a meeting with engineering on a new feature we’re building and complete the first draft of first quarter objectives and key results. By 11 a.m., I felt like I was already winning the day. Each morning, I first ensure that those top three priorities I defined the day before are scheduled into my calendar. It is my way of forcing myself to prioritize and make sure that what needs to get done gets done efficiently. It’s a daily practice of acknowledging that while I can do anything, I can’t do everything (at least not all at once). The real hack here is using your calendar as your to-do list. If it doesn’t fit into your calendar, it’s not getting done. An hour in the morning for research. Ninety minutes after lunch to write. Thirty minutes before signing off to clear my inbox. This process isn’t just about scheduling — it’s a forcing function for prioritization. When your day is limited to 24 hours, not everything makes the cut, and that’s the point. Why does this work? Because when a task is on your calendar, it’s real. You’ve committed to it. And when you commit, you execute. Don’t hide behind your to-do list. Own your time by turning it into a plan that delivers. Every Friday before I log off for the weekend, I plan the next week. It’s a quiet moment of reflection and foresight, identifying my top three priorities and setting the stage for a week in which I can hit the ground running. I block time next week for big projects while anticipating potential challenges and making space for deep work. It’s a simple routine that allows me to head into the weekend with a clear mind and begin at full speed on Monday. Oh, and the best part: no more Sunday night worries about what I’ve forgotten for the week ahead. Mindful productivity isn’t about squeezing every second out of your day. It’s about being fully present and intentional with the time you have. It’s about creating a harmony that doesn’t just make you more productive but also more at peace. And it’s not just a way to work — it applies to my personal life, too. Whether it’s an afternoon outing with my husband or a coffee date with a friend, these practices help me stay grounded in the present moment and align my time with what I value the most. The goal isn’t to get more done. The goal is to get things done so that you can satisfy  your work appetite, pay attention to your surroundings and be as emotionally present to yourself and your loved ones in off-work times as you are during work hours."
"Hate running, or even the idea of running? Me too, until I started hacking it",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/04/health/start-to-run-for-fun-wellness/index.html,"I found another person who hates running, and I’m not surprised. “I find it tedious and boring, and I feel like I’m failing at it all the time because I’m so slow and out of breath.” That’s how my colleague Madeline Holcombe articulated how it’s going as she’s started to take up running. Madeline writes wellness stories for CNN and is highly versed in the many health benefits of running, and the convenience (and frugality) of not really needing special equipment (shoes, maybe earphones, perhaps a watch to track distance), or a specific space to do it. She’s also a former competitive dancer. But none of that necessarily means running is an easy or enjoyable habit to start. Madeline’s assessment mirrors how I felt when I started running 20 years ago, and how many others feel, too. Now that I enjoy it — and even look forward to it — I can articulate how I got from point A to point B. In my case, point A was an embarrassing jog with a new girlfriend in my late 20s, and point B was finishing multiple marathons. Like my running itself, it was a slow yet largely fun journey. Some people enjoy running solo, and some prefer logging miles with a partner or a group. I love all of the above, and you’ll find out which one is more fun or distracting for you by trying each. Catching up with an old friend over a run is great. Organized groups build community and accountability, and they are everywhere (just check out your local running shoe store, gym or online sites). They sometimes socialize afterward, too. Meanwhile races can deliver a big surge of energy and support, and they can also be a motivator for the training they require. Conversely, running alone means no pressure to keep up, combined with the joy of listening to whatever you want. When I began running regularly, it was while living in Bangkok, which is not a run-friendly city, on a treadmill in the basement of my apartment building. The only thing I enjoyed about it initially was a series of music mixes I made to pass the time. They were short and fun to curate. Later incarnations, when I lived in Brooklyn, evolved into the use of music apps that made run mixes at various tempos and a useful way to find more songs for my personal running collection. (You could share your favorites in the comments section!) Later, as my runs got longer, my listening library included some (not all) podcasts and audiobooks (particularly my guilty pleasure of celebrity memoirs) that I find particularly engrossing. More recently, as I trained for marathons, I started listening to the audio of favorite movies — ones I know and love so well that I can “see” the film in my head while listening and running. What all of these have in common is that they are distracting from running itself. I know running purists will make the case that listening to nothing keeps them in tune with their bodies, or that it’s a joy to be alone with your thoughts while running. That’s OK for them. But if listening to your favorite mix, podcast, books and even movies will be more entertaining and therefore distracting from the un-fun of running, just do it, as one running shoe manufacturer might say. All respect to treadmill runners (who can actually watch their favorite movies while running), but another aspect of running that is often joy-inducing, is running outside. Trail runs, or even a paved path through trees taps into another form of wellness. Want to feel like a kid again? Run (carefully) in heavy rain or over snow. My first real (embarrassing) run, was an easy jog through a beautiful park in Madison, Wisconsin. I was there visiting my marathon-running, “Chariots of Fire”-loving girlfriend at the time and couldn’t keep up even when she slowed down for me. Later we moved to Bangkok where I started putting in treadmill hours, and then we spent a year traveling around the world. When you rarely stay in the same place for more than a couple of days, as we were, the only exercise besides walking that was available to us were runs. And those runs were the best, filled with joie de vivre. We found running was a novel way to explore the streets of Beijing, the parks of London and the Mongolian steppe. I still make a point to organize runs for myself when I travel. A predawn 6-mile (10-kilometer) romp along empty canals in Amsterdam, a sprint along the Black Sea in Sochi, Russia, and a jingle jog through a snowy, Christmas-y Reykjavík suburb are cherished travel memories that transcend the drudgery of running. I once made a goal of running every path and unpaved trail in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, near where we used to live. I highlighted them on a map and then combined segments to create the Greatest Prospect Park Run of All Time. You could treat your neighborhood or a nearby park the same way. These days I mostly run to coffee shops. I have a coffee and a treat with my journal (carried in a running backpack) and then run back, listening to favorite music, a podcast, book or movie. No one is having more fun exercising than I am. Finally, back to Madeline’s new-runner lament that feeling slow and getting out of breath is contributing to her dislike of it. First, being out of breath will take care of itself. The more you run, the more you can run. Reaching the point of exhaustion will grow longer and longer. There are techniques such as alternating running with walking that can be helpful to beginners. And pay attention to the early, if brief wins, where it actually feels powerful or fluid to run, even just a few strides at first. As for being slow, my advice would be to be zen about it. If you run alone, no problem at all. If you run with others and you feel you’re holding them back, find other running buddies, at least initially. In races, runners are grouped in corrals based on speed, which reduces feelings of being too slow. Find your corral and know that as you stick with it, your pace will speed up, slow down, even vary between days. There’s no need for speed, unless that sounds fun, of course.

"Limit coffee-drinking to this time window to lower early death risk, study suggests",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/health/coffee-drinking-timing-death-risk-wellness/index.html,"Drinking coffee has repeatedly been linked with better heart health and prolonged life. But the benefits of coffee consumption could depend on when you drink it, new research has found. Limiting coffee intake to the morning, it turns out, may be best — and that seems to be regardless of the amount consumed and other potentially influential factors, according to a study published Tuesday in the European Heart Journal. “This is the first study testing coffee drinking timing patterns and health outcomes,” said lead author Dr. Lu Qi, HCA Regents Distinguished Chair and professor at Tulane University’s Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, in a news release. “We don’t typically give advice about timing in our dietary guidance, but perhaps we should be thinking about this in the future.” Most past research investigating participants’ coffee intake over time have found moderate levels of coffee consumption may be associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and premature death, according to the latest study. But scientific evidence of whether factors such as genetics, amount consumed or added sweeteners affect these relationships has been inconsistent or, at times, controversial, the authors said. The authors studied the dietary and health data of 40,725 adults age 18 and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 1999 to 2018. During 10 cycles over the years, those participants provided details of their dietary intake from the previous day. The authors also included a subgroup of 1,463 adults, from both the women’s and men’s versions of the Lifestyle Validation Study, who had completed at least one weeklong dietary record. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee were included, and timing was categorized in three periods: morning (from 4 a.m. to 11:59 a.m.), afternoon (from 12 p.m. to 4:59 p.m.) and evening (from 5 p.m. to 3:59 a.m.). The researchers identified two patterns of timing of consumption: morning and all day. By the end of the median follow-up period of nearly 10 years, there were 4,295 deaths from all causes, 1,268 from cardiovascular disease and 934 from cancer. Compared with people who weren’t coffee drinkers, having coffee only in the morning was associated with a 16% lower risk of premature death from any cause and a 31% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Those who tended to drink coffee all day didn’t have a reduction in risk. These findings remained even after the authors took into account confounders such as sleep hours, age, race, ethnicity, sex, family income, education, physical activity levels, a dietary score, and health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol. For morning coffee drinkers, the amount of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee consumed didn’t matter, either — whether they drank less than one or more than three cups of coffee daily.  Having done so in the morning was still better than other patterns in terms of mortality risk. “The study was observational, meaning that it wasn’t an experiment setting, (which) is the gold standard,” said Vanessa King, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics who wasn’t involved in the study, via email. The nature of the study also means it only establishes an association, not a causal relationship between morning coffee drinking and early death risk. But the findings are “meaningful as the leading cause of death in America is cardiovascular diseases,” King added. Dr. David Kao, who wasn’t involved in the research, found the study to be “fascinating” and one of the best investigations on this topic in years, he said. “Highlights include using a machine learning-style method to categorize coffee drinking patterns, and validation of findings in (more than one) external data source which are distinct from the primary source, which greatly reduces the likelihood of an accidental/false positive finding,” Kao, the Jacqueline Marie Schauble Leaffer Endowed Chair in Women’s Heart Health at the University of Colorado Anschutz, said via email. However, the study has a few other shortcomings: For one, recollections of dietary intake are subject to inaccuracies or biases, and they don’t account for long-term habits, the authors said. Secondly, even though the authors considered multiple confounders, it’s possible there were others that couldn’t be completely ruled out, they said — such as variations in work shifts and times of getting up for the day. The team also “could not exclude the possibility that the morning-type coffee drinking pattern is a marker for an overall healthy lifestyle,” according to the study. “For example, morning-type coffee drinkers may be more willing to exercise and eat non-ultra-processed foods.” Additionally, genetic information wasn’t available, so the authors were unable to examine any possible effect of genetically determined caffeine metabolism rates. A possible explanation for the findings “is that consuming coffee in the afternoon or evening may disrupt circadian rhythms and levels of hormones such as melatonin,” Qi said. Low levels of melatonin have been linked with higher levels of blood pressure and oxidative stress, and greater cardiovascular disease risk. Coffee also contains antioxidants that reduce inflammation in the body by neutralizing free radicals that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, King said. Free radicals, unstable molecules from environmental sources such as cigarette smoke or pesticides, can harm cells. Some inflammatory markers in the blood have their own clocks, the authors said, and they are typically highest in the morning — so “the anti-inflammatory effect of a pattern of coffee consumption concentrated in the morning may be more beneficial than that of a pattern … spread across morning, afternoon and evening.” That applies to both caffeinated and decaf coffee consumption. If you want to start restricting your coffee intake to the morning but are having trouble, consider whether you’re regularly getting enough quality rest, King said. Seeing a sleep specialist to find out whether you have a condition, such as sleep apnea, disturbing your rest could also be useful, Kao said. You can also begin with diluting your daytime servings and accompanying them with water for hydration, King said — which can also help you feel more awake.

If you don’t drink coffee and think you could gain from adding it to your routine, first “look at the bigger picture,” said Anderson-Haynes, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Are you living an overall physically active, balanced, sustainable and healthy diet and lifestyle?” Until more evidence is provided about when to drink coffee, she added, follow your doctor or dietitian’s recommendation on caffeine intake."
"Americans’ rage at insurers goes beyond health coverage – author of ‘Delay, Deny, Defend’ points to 3 reforms that could help",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/health/health-care-reform-delay-deny-defend-author-conversation-partner/index.html,"My book “Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don’t Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It” was thrust into the spotlight recently, after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed in what authorities say was a targeted attack outside the company’s annual investors conference. Investigators at the scene found bullet casings inscribed with the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose.” The unsettling echo of the book’s title struck me and many others. READ MORE: 5 of the most frustrating health insurer tactics and why they exist That killing – and the torrent of online outrage that followed – put Americans’ unhappiness with health insurers at the front of the national conversation. Many people responded not by mourning Thompson, but by blaming UnitedHealthcare and other insurers for failing to pay for essential medical treatments. Gleeful online trolls even celebrated the alleged killer as a heroic vigilante. Speaking as an insurance scholar, I think few should be surprised by this ghoulish reaction. The killing revealed many Americans’ resentment and even rage about insurance companies. And while the focus has been on health insurance, these frustrations extend across the broader insurance landscape. Homeowners insurance, for example, is becoming harder to get in many stateseven as coverage is shrinking, and auto insurance rates are skyrocketing. These trends are fueling widespread discontent with insurers of all kinds. As many recent stories of health insurance denials in the news show, policyholders are most outraged when insurers fail to keep their promises to pay claims promptly and fairly. And as I read people’s stories about their own experiences, I kept hearing echoes from my book. Too often, people say, insurance companies delay paying some claims, deny other valid claims altogether, and force policyholders to defend themselves in court – all to increase profits by cutting claim costs. But problems often begin long before anyone files a claim. Insurance consumers generally don’t know much about what they are buying. For homeowners, auto and many other types of insurance, companies seldom provide copies of policy language or accessible summaries of policy terms to prospective policyholders. READ MORE: Why home insurance rates are rising fast across the US – climate change plays a big role Even when consumers have access to policies, many don’t read or can’t understand the long, complex legal documents. Similarly, they can’t anticipate the many ways a loss could occur or the problems that could result if it does. As a result, they are only aware of a few key terms and otherwise believe that they will be “in good hands” with a “good neighbor,” to quote two of the iconic phrases of insurance advertising. Then, when consumers need coverage, they discover that there are significant protection gaps. Health insurance can involve a tangle of limitations due to provider networks, medical necessity rules and preauthorization requirements. Homeowners reasonably expect that they will be fully covered for all major losses, but insurers have cut back coverage to account for rising costs due to inflation and climate change. As a result, when disaster strikes, too many Americans feel like they haven’t gotten the security they already paid for. Rebuilding trust in insurance won’t be easy, but it’s essential. Insurance is the great protector of financial security for the American middle class, but only when it works. As the recent reaction demonstrates, it needs to work better. The insurance industry won’t change by itself; the financial pressures on insurers from increasing losses and fierce market competition are too great. In order for insurance to serve its goals, lawmakers and regulators will need to take action. Based on my research, I see three big areas for improvement. First, the government can help make the market for insurance work better. Markets need information, and better information produces better results. Regulators should require that key information about coverage be available in an accessible format for all types of insurance. READ MORE: Luigi Mangione isn’t the first alleged criminal to capture many people’s imaginations – and hearts Consumers also need information on the quality of companies offering policies, and whether a company pays claims promptly and fairly is a key measure of quality. Consumers don’t have access to much reliable information on that now, so disclosure should be mandated there as well. Second, states would be wise to consider minimum coverage standards, especially for homeowners insurance, as insurers have been cutting back on coverage recently to reduce costs. New York addressed a similar problem in 1943, legislatively adopting a Standard Fire Policy, since copied in many states. Some 70 years later, the Affordable Care Act did something similar by requiring that insurers cover 10 “Essential Health Benefits.” In both cases, lawmakers set minimum standards that every company must meet. States again need to consider whether insurance coverage is too important to be left purely to the vagaries of the market. READ MORE: How Florida’s home insurance market became so dysfunctional, so fast Third, policyholders need effective remedies when insurance companies are found to have acted unreasonably. Many insurance claims result in good-faith disputes about how much the insurance company should pay — for example, whether roof damage was caused by hail, which is usually covered by insurance, or just wear and tear, which isn’t. But other times, insurance companies deny claims after inadequate investigations or for spurious reasons. For example, a 2023 Washington Post investigation concluded that in the wake of Hurricane Ian, some Florida insurance companies aggressively sought to limit payouts by altering the work of their adjusters who inspected damaged homes. Some policyholders and their families had their Hurricane Ian claims reduced by 45% to 97%. The American Policyholder Association, a nonprofit insurance industry watchdog group, claimed to find “compelling evidence of what appears to be multiple instances of systematic criminal fraud perpetrated to cheat policyholders out of fair insurance claims.” When people find themselves in this sort of situation, they have to spend lots of time and effort fighting to get what they were owed in the first place. Even when an insurance company eventually relents, it still hasn’t fulfilled its original promise to the policyholder to settle claims promptly and fairly. In these cases, requiring additional compensation to policyholders and insurer disincentives for unreasonable conduct would level the playing field. The deep resentment many Americans feel toward insurance companies became apparent after the killing of Brian Thompson. Reforms such as these would be a meaningful response to that resentment."
Norovirus cases are surging. A doctor explains what to look for,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/31/health/norovirus-cases-increase-wellness/index.html,"A common stomach bug is surging, according to new data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the week of December 5, there were 91 outbreaks of norovirus reported, up from 69 the previous week. In the same period in recent years, there generally were 65 or less outbreaks per week. (It might not seem like a lot, but many more cases probably go unreported.) With cases on the rise, more people may want to know how norovirus is spread, what symptoms to expect and how long they can expect to be sick. What should they do if they think they may have it? At what point should they go to the doctor? What food safety tips can reduce the risk of spreading norovirus? And what else can be done to prevent the spread of it and other foodborne illnesses? To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner, with responsibilities that included overseeing infectious diseases as well as food safety. CNN: What exactly is norovirus? Dr. Leana Wen: Norovirus is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the US. According to the CDC, it is responsible for 19 million to 21 million illnesses every year. It results in over 2.2 million outpatient medical visits, 465,000 emergency department visits and 109,000 hospitalizations. Also sometimes called the Norwalk virus or winter vomiting bug, norovirus is an extremely contagious virus. It is a common cause of illness outbreaks on cruise ships, where more than 90% of diarrheal illnesses are attributed to this virus. It also causes outbreaks in schools, day care centers, jails and other settings where individuals come into proximity with others. CNN: How is norovirus spread? Wen: Norovirus can be spread through direct contact with an infected person or through contaminated surfaces. If you share food or drink or utensils with an infected person, you could pick up the virus. You could also contract it by touching a surface that an infected person touched and then touching your mouth. In addition, the virus could be transmitted through tiny drops of vomit or fecal material that splatter onto surfaces. CNN: What symptoms should people expect and for how long? Wen: Symptoms of norovirus include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps. Some people may also experience fatigue, low-grade fever, chills, headaches and muscle aches. It’s common for people to go from feeling well to suddenly having gastrointestinal symptoms. These symptoms can be unnerving and unpleasant. The good news is that most people improve within one to two days and recover completely, with no long-term health effects. There are, though, some people who become severely ill from norovirus, usually because they are unable to keep down fluids and become very dehydrated. CNN: What should people do if they think they may have it? Wen: There is no specific treatment for norovirus. As this is a virus, antibiotics that target bacteria won’t work. There is no directed antiviral against the norovirus, nor is there an approved vaccine to prevent it. Most people will recover without medical intervention. The key is to try to keep down fluids to prevent dehydration, which can be a common side effect. Adults should drink water and most other fluids, including juice and sports drinks. Children can benefit from Pedialyte and other similar electrolyte solutions that are specifically formulated for kids with vomiting and diarrhea. Nursing moms should continue breastfeeding, even if they or their kids are experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms. CNN: At what point should people go to the doctor? Wen: People should contact their doctor if they have specific concerning symptoms, if they cannot keep up hydration, and if they are especially vulnerable to severe illness. Those with typical norovirus symptoms can generally let the illness run its course. However, if they have blood in the stool, high fevers, shortness of breath or other unusual symptoms, they should consider consulting a medical professional — since what they have may not be norovirus. Those with norovirus should start feeling better in a couple of days after symptoms begin. If symptoms don’t improve, that’s another reason to visit the doctor. In addition, it’s crucial to keep up hydration. If someone is vomiting so much that they are unable to keep down fluids, they should also see a health care professional. Families with babies who are no longer making the same number of wet diapers should also call their clinician. Those who are especially vulnerable should have a lower threshold for contacting their health care provider. This includes babies and young children, older individuals and people with serious underlying medical conditions such as having kidney or heart disease and being immunocompromised. They may need a clinician to keep an extra close watch on them during their illness. CNN: What food safety tips can reduce the risk of spreading norovirus? Wen: People who have symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramping should not be preparing food. They shouldn’t handle food or plates or utensils for others until at least two days after their symptoms subside. It’s also a good idea to wash your hands before eating. You may have touched a doorknob, elevator button, serving spoon or some other surface that an infected person touched. If someone in the household has norovirus, be aware that the virus can spread easily through the family. Everyone should regularly wash their hands well with soap and water, especially before eating and after using the bathroom. Infected surfaces can be cleaned with solutions containing bleach to kill the virus. In addition, be aware that there are other foodborne illnesses, too, such as E. coli, salmonella and listeria. There are additional precautions that can prevent the spread of these illnesses, too. CNN: Please remind us what some of these precautions are. Wen: Don’t drink raw milk or eat raw or undercooked meat. Use an internal thermometer and make sure that what you are cooking reaches the recommended temperature. Don’t eat perishable food that has been left out for more than two hours. Be sure to wash vegetables and fruits well and keep them separated from raw meat. Everyone preparing or serving food should wash their hands well. Do not prepare food or share meals with people while having gastrointestinal symptoms. If everyone practices good hand hygiene with frequent handwashing — and using hand sanitizer when running water isn’t easily accessible — we could reduce the chance of contracting and spreading norovirus and other gastrointestinal illnesses."
"Lead and cadmium found in muscle-building protein powders, report says",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/health/protein-powder-heavy-metals-wellness/index.html,"Over-the-counter protein powders may contain disturbing levels of lead and cadmium, with the highest amounts found in plant-based, organic and chocolate-flavored products, according to a new investigation. There is no level of lead that is safe for humans, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Cadmium is a carcinogen which is also toxic to the body’s heart, kidneys, gut, brain, respiratory and reproductive systems, according to the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration. “On average, organic protein powders had three times more lead and twice the amount of cadmium compared to non-organic products,” said Jaclyn Bowen, executive director of the Clean Label Project, a nonprofit dedicated to transparent food labeling that released the new report Thursday. Plant-based powders, such as those made from soy, rice, peas and other plants, contained three times more lead than whey-based products, according to the report. (Whey is the liquid byproduct of cheesemaking.) Plants naturally absorb heavy metals from the planet’s crust but can contain elevated levels if grown in soil that has been further contaminated by mining, industrial waste, and some pesticides and fertilizers. Another key source of contamination in protein powders was chocolate flavoring, according to the report. “Chocolate-flavored protein powders contained four times more lead and up to 110 times more cadmium than vanilla-flavored powders,” Bowen said. Despite being rich in flavonoids, antioxidants and other beneficial minerals, dark chocolate, or cacao, has been found to contain high levels of heavy metals. A July 2024 study found 43% of six dozen dark chocolate products exceeded California’s Proposition 65’s maximum allowable dose level for lead of 0.5 parts per million. “Heavy metal contaminant is a global food safety problem,” Bowen said. “These contaminants are basically everywhere, including in things that are being represented as health foods.” The Council for Responsible Nutrition, an industry association that represents supplement manufacturers, told CNN via email that the new report did not provide sufficient transparency about the criteria used for contamination thresholds and how products were selected. “Without such clarity, consumers and industry stakeholders cannot fully evaluate the validity of the claims,” said Andrea Wong, CRN’s senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs. “Modern analytical techniques can detect even trace levels of naturally occurring elements, such as heavy metals, which are present in soil, air, and water,” Wong said. “These trace levels are often well below established safety thresholds set by federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).” For the new investigation, the Clean Label Project purchased 160 products from 70 of the best-selling brands of protein powders. The brands were not disclosed in the report, however. “We do not disclose the names of companies we test in order to maintain fairness and consistency and to avoid potential conflicts of interest,” Bowen said. Protein powder samples were then sent to an independent certified laboratory, which ran nearly 36,000 individual tests on 258 different contaminants, including heavy metals, bisphenols, phthalates and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. However, only levels of lead, cadmium, bisphenol A and its cousin bisphenol S, more commonly known as BPA and BPS, were included in the 2024 report. Data on other contaminants will be released in a later update, Bowen said. Bisphenols are hormone disruptors that studies have linked to fetal abnormalities, low birth weight, and brain and behavior disorders in infants and children. In adults, the chemicals are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, erectile dysfunction, cancer and a 49% higher risk of early death within 10 years. Bisphenol A was widely used to create baby bottles, sippy cups and infant formula containers until frightened parents boycotted those products more than a decade ago. A similar investigation of protein powders by Clean Label in 2018 found high levels of bisphenols. The 2024 report, however, had good news, Bowen said. “We found BPA and BPS in only three of 160 protein powders, compared to 55% of the products we tested in 2018,” she said. To analyze heavy metals, researchers at the Clean Label Project compared lead and cadmium testing results with levels established by California’s Proposition 65. “Prop 65 is arguably the most progressive law in the land when it comes to industrial environmental contaminants,” Bowen said. “They have very clear pass-fail criteria that is typically much stricter than federal agencies in the US.” Overall, 47% of the 160 protein powder samples tested by the Clean Label Project in 2024 exceeded Prop 65 regulatory guidelines, the report said. About 21% of the powders contained levels twice as high as the Prop 65 limit, Bowen said. Nearly 80% of the plant-based and organic protein powders tested were over the Prop 65 limit for lead. However, only 26% of collagen-based protein products and 28% of the whey-based products exceeded the California lead limit. It’s not necessary to stop using protein powders as part of a healthy lifestyle, Bowen said, but it does help to shop smart. “For people following a fully plant-based diet, protein powders made from peas appear to have the lowest levels of heavy metals,” she said. “If you don’t have any dietary restrictions, the data suggests that whey-based or egg-based, vanilla-flavored protein powders will have the least amount.” Reaching out to favorite brands to inquire about contaminant levels is another smart action by consumers, Bowen added. “Ask questions, demand answers,” she said. “The topic of heavy metals isn’t going away.”"
There’s going to be even more harmful content on social media as Meta drops fact-checkers. What to tell your kids,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/health/parents-kids-social-media-meta-wellness/index.html,"Many parents were already worried about their kids being exposed to false information and other harmful content on social media before Meta’s surprise decision to drop its fact-checkers. Now, there’s reason to fear things are going to get even worse. On Tuesday, Meta announced it’s ending its fact-checking partnerships for Instagram and Facebook in the United States. Instead, users will be able to write “community notes” on problematic posts. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that, as a result, the company will catch less “bad stuff” posted on its platforms. It’s not like social media platforms were all vetted and had strong sourcing for users’ posts before. But Zuckerberg’s decision makes it even more important for children to be taught how to sort out what they should and should not believe on social media. Parents can also use this opportunity to talk to their kids about why they should never share or act on claims they see online without fact-checking them first. Here’s what to teach them. To figure out whether a social media post is accurate, the mainstream media is a good place to start. “Consider whether other credible, mainstream news outlets are reporting the same news,” said James P. Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization that helps parents and teachers instill critical thinking skills in children. “If they’re not, it doesn’t mean it’s not true, but it does mean you should dig deeper.” To learn how to understand media coverage, parents should encourage kids to “consume more news, not less,” said Dr. Jingsi Christina Wu, associate professor of media studies at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York, via email. You can do so by reading or watching the news together and then discussing it. Wu said the more children consume news, the more they gain the cognitive ability to interpret it. When evaluating posts, Steyer said kids should also be taught to consider who made the content, whether they appear trustworthy, what their motivations might be and who might benefit from or be hurt by it. In particular, Wu said, kids should be told that “your favorite influencers are not experts.” Parents can explain that it’s “OK to watch your favorite TikTokers or YouTubers for their entertainment value or special experiences, but they are not credentialed experts on facts and they have their own biases about the world.” Similarly, children (and their parents) shouldn’t assume something is true simply because it’s gotten a lot of views or likes. “Virality does not equal truth,” Wu warned. In fact, she said, “Fake news travels faster by taking advantage of human instincts for sharing abnormal stories.” Looking for small errors in things such as spelling and grammar is another way to spot unreliable posts, Wu said. She also suggested encouraging kids to look at details in pictures and videos for signs they’ve been manipulated. For example, a hand with the wrong number of fingers could be a giveaway that artificial Intelligence generated it, she said. Kids should also consider it a red flag if a piece of content provokes strong emotions in them, Steyer said. “Misinformation and disinformation are created to get extreme reactions out of people.” Children should be taught not to consume inaccurate or extremist content because algorithms are designed to show people what they think they like — so the more they watch or engage with particular types of posts, the more likely they are to be fed more content that is similar. Kids should know that, when they consume content, creators often profit from their views, said Dr. Devorah Heitner, the Chicago-based author of “Growing Up in Public: Coming of Age in a Digital World.” This happens because higher view counts often allow creators to make more money from ads. It’s another reason to steer clear of content that is false or otherwise problematic. When I speak to parents in schools about how to handle their kids’ social media use, I suggest consuming social media content about topics that interest their children together. For example, if a kid is interested in becoming a veterinarian, they can watch videos from zoos around the world. Then, even when the parent isn’t present, algorithms are likely to feed the child similar posts. Wu said parents should also encourage their kids to talk to them when they’re unsure how to judge whether content is accurate. Even if parents suspect it’s fake, it’s not a good idea to say so right away. “Children might feel judged or dismissed if parents simply laugh things off or outright brush off all online content as fake or untrustworthy,” she warned. Instead, Wu suggested that parents do research with their children. “This approach keeps the dialogue open and also alleviates … the stress of being all-knowing at all times,” she said. “It also demonstrates to the kids that learning never stops and media literacy is a muscle that needs to be exercised.” Thanks to Meta’s new policy, I expect that children will be exposed to even more dangerous content on social media. But parents can protect kids by teaching them how to evaluate what they see online, so they know what to believe and how to avoid problematic posts."
Special counsel report condemns Trump’s ‘criminal efforts to retain power’ in 2020,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/politics/special-counsel-smith-report-trump-2020-election-subversion/index.html,"Attorney General Merrick Garland has publicly released special counsel Jack Smith’s report on his investigation into Donald Trump and efforts to overturn the 2020 election, detailing the president-elect’s “criminal efforts to retain power” and projecting confidence in the investigation. The more than 130-page report, which was submitted to Congress and released early Tuesday after a court hold blocking its release expired at midnight, spells out in extensive — if largely already known — detail how Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election. Smith’s team states in no uncertain terms that they believed Trump criminally attempted to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election results. “As set forth in the original and superseding indictments, when it became clear that Mr. Trump had lost the election and that lawful means of challenging the election results had failed, he resorted to a series of criminal efforts to retain power,” the report states. The transmission of Smith’s January 6 findings came after the president-elect and his allies were unable to stop the department from releasing it. Their court maneuverings did, however, slow the report’s release as the clock ticks toward Trump’s January 20 inauguration, as well as upend the department’s plans to release volume two, which covers the classified documents investigation. The attorney general has decided not to publicly release that second volume of the report after the special counsel recommended against its publication. Volume one of Smith’s report marks the special counsel’s final official word on his investigation into January 6, 2021, and the actions by Trump and his associates before then to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power. It contains a factual recitation of Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, including his “pressure on state officials,” the “fraudulent electors plan,” his “pressure on the Vice President” Mike Pence, and a section on how Trump’s supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6. In effect, it mirrors the landmark federal election subversion indictment that Smith brought against Trump in 2023, retooled in 2024 after the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, and ultimately withdrew after Trump’s victory in the November election. “Until Mr. Trump obstructed it, this democratic process had operated in a peaceful and orderly manner for more than 130 years,” Smith wrote, referring to Congress’ certification of the Electoral College results, under the Electoral Count Act of 1887. When it came to his duty as special counsel and the work of investigating and prosecuting Trump, Smith wrote that his “office had one north star, to follow the facts and law wherever they led. Nothing more and nothing less.” Of the failed prosecution of Trump, Smith said that prosecutors “cannot control outcomes” and can only do their jobs “the right way for the right reasons.” The final decision to prosecute the former president, he said, was his alone. “It is a decision I stand behind fully,” Smith wrote. “To have done otherwise on the facts developed during our work would have been to shirk my duties as a prosecutor and a public servant.” Smith concluded that while the Justice Department interprets the Constitution as not allowing the prosecution of a sitting president, his office “assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.” Trump, for his part, slammed the special counsel’s report as “fake findings” in overnight posts on his Truth Social network. “Jack is a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election, which I won in a landslide,” the president-elect wrote in part. “THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN!!!” Smith brought four charges against Trump in the 2020 election probe. But the case suffered setbacks culminating in the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling last summer that set a very high bar for prosecuting a former president for his conduct in office. The special counsel dropped the case against Trump altogether after voters in November decided to return him to the White House. In a private letter to Garland on January 7, made public as part of the report, Smith condemned Trump’s claim of complete exoneration as false and said his office “stands fully behind” the merits of the criminal cases that he filed. Smith had been responding to a prior letter from Trump’s lawyers, in which they claimed he was fully exonerated because Smith withdrew both criminal cases after the election. “Mr. Trump’s letter claims that dismissal of his criminal cases signifies Mr. Trump’s ‘complete exoneration.’ That is false,” Smith wrote to Garland. Smith continued: “The (Justice) Department’s view that the Constitution prohibits Mr. Trump’s indictment and prosecution while he is in office is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government’s proof, or the merits of the prosecution — all of which the Office stands fully behind.” The special counsel’s office weighed bringing an insurrection charge against Trump but decided against doing so, with the scant case law for such a prosecution a major factor in that decision. While courts have been describing the US Capitol assault as an “insurrection,” the special counsel’s office was “aware of the litigation risk that would be presented by employing this long-dormant statute.” Of particular concern was that the special counsel couldn’t find a past case of prosecuting someone “inciting, assisting, or giving aid or comfort to rebellion or insurrection.” Instead, the rare, previous prosecutions dealt with someone who directly engaged in an insurrection, according to the report. Smith said of the evidence against Trump: “However strong the proof that he incited or gave aid and comfort to those who attacked the Capitol, application of those theories of liability would also have been a first.” Smith’s office also looked at other possible charges, according to the report. The prosecutors opted against a charge alleging conspiracy to impede or injure an officer of the United States because of insufficient proof that the co-conspirators “specifically agreed to threaten force or intimidation against federal officers.” A charge under the Anti-Riot Act was considered but not brought, Smith said, pointing to how that statute has been winnowed down by courts. Trump was ultimately charged with four counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of an official proceeding. The report details how the special counsel and his team considered possible defenses that Trump might raise in court over his conduct around January 6, before they presented the indictment to a grand jury. Those arguments included that Trump might claim “he acted in good faith when he sought to stop the transfer of presidential power because he genuinely believed that outcome-determinative fraud had undermined the election’s integrity and caused him to lose.” Instead, the special counsel wrote, Trump knowingly worked to deceive others – an effort that “was pervasive throughout the charged conspiracies.” “This was not a case in which Mr. Trump merely misstated a fact or two in a handful of isolated instances,” Smith wrote. “On a repeated basis, he and co-conspirators used specific and knowingly false claims of election fraud in his calls and meetings with state officials, in an effort to induce them to overturn the results of the election in their states.” Smith also wrote that any argument Trump was merely following the advice of his attorneys wouldn’t hold up because the attorneys were involved in the alleged criminal conduct and Trump was not relying on them for advice but rather as people who could provide legal cover for his efforts. Addressing the potential argument that Trump was exercising his rights to free speech, Smith wrote that because Trump used “knowingly false statements regarding specific facts to commit the crimes charged…they were not protected by the First Amendment.” Following his indictment in the case, Trump’s targeting of witnesses through posts on social media presented “a significant challenge,” Smith wrote. Trump was ultimately placed under a gag order after extensive court filings from Smith detailing his posts and comments on individuals involved in the case, including the judge overseeing the case. “Mr. Trump’s resort to intimidation and harassment during the investigation was not new, as demonstrated by his actions during the charged conspiracies,” Smith wrote. Smith called the effort of using social media to “publicly attack and seek to influence” people, including state and federal officials, judges and election workers, “a fundamental component” of his conduct “underlying the charges in the Election Case.” “After Mr. Trump publicly assailed these individuals, threats and harassment from his followers inevitably followed,” Smith wrote, adding that “the same pattern transpired after Mr. Trump’s indictment.” The special counsel said his office would not have prosecuted Trump if he was merely exercising his free speech rights by engaging in “exaggeration or rough-and-tumble politics.” The prosecutor also described Trump’s alleged conduct as going beyond challenging the election results in court. “The conduct of Mr. Trump and co-conspirators, however, went well beyond speaking their minds or contesting the election results though our legal system,” Smith said in his report. “Instead, Mr. Trump targeted a key federal government function – the process by which the United States collects, counts, and certifies the results of the presidential election – and sought to obstruct or defeat it through fraud and deceit.” Over the course of more than 20 pages, Smith laid out why he believed the unprecedented prosecution was justified, while arguing there was no alternative to a federal criminal prosecution for holding Trump accountable. Not only was there “considerable federal interest in protecting the integrity of the United States’ electoral process” that “weighed in favor of proceeding,” Smith said in explaining his decision to bring charges, there was “federal interest defending from future harm the United States’ exceptional tradition of peaceful transitions of presidential power.” He pointed to other interests that he said justified the prosecution, including protecting election officials from violence, counting every citizen’s vote and the “evenhanded administration of law.” “To date, more than 1,500 people have been criminally charged for their roles in the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol,” Smith said, speaking to the need for an evenhanded administration of the law. “With that in mind, Mr. Trump’s relative culpability weighed heavily in favor of charging him, as the individual most responsible for what occurred at the Capitol on January 6.” At the time of his indictment, Smith noted, the Georgia election subversion case against Trump had not been brought, and once it had, it did not “fully address” Trump’s election-related conduct. Moreover, even if the impeachment proceeding against Trump had resulted in a conviction by the Senate, that would not have been sufficient to address the federal interest, Smith said. As part of the 2020 election subversion probe, federal investigators interviewed more than 250 witnesses and brought more than 55 people to testify before a grand jury, according to the report. That includes interviews conducted during Smith’s tenure and before the probe became a special counsel investigation in late 2023. Investigators also examined “voluminous records,” including emails, text messages, encrypted messages and other documents, which they obtained in some cases through search warrants and subpoenas. They reviewed more than one terabyte of data from public sources, including social media platforms. After charging Trump, the special counsel’s office had continued to investigate the unindicted co-conspirators, Smith said in his report. The office found evidence that one subject of the investigation, who was not named, may have committed unrelated crimes, and that investigation was referred to a US attorney’s office, according to the report. In the federal election probe, the special counsel ultimately did not bring additional indictments, even as the prosecutors had made a “preliminary determination” that charges against “certain” co-conspirators could be justified. “This Report should not be read to allege that any particular person other than Mr. Trump committed a crime, nor should it be read to exonerate any particular person,” the report said. Before dropping the case against Trump, the office had begun a discussion over whether potential charges against additional co-conspirators would be brought in Trump’s case or in a separate case. “Because the Office reached no final conclusions and did not seek indictments against anyone other than Mr. Trump – the head of the criminal conspiracies and their intended beneficiary – this Report does not elaborate further on the investigation and preliminary assessment of uncharged individuals,” Smith said. The special counsel team, Smith said, went out of its way not to interfere with the 2024 election by abiding by longstanding Justice Department policies for how to handle investigations during an election year. The note marks an implicit rebuttal to Trump’s oft-repeated claim that the probe itself, the indictment and the potential trial were all part of an “election interference” effort by liberal prosecutors who were trying to defeat his campaign. “Throughout its work, the Office was focused entirely on its mandate to uphold the law, and nothing more,” the report said. “The career prosecutors in the Office conducted its investigation and prosecution in a manner that complied fully with the Department’s policies regarding election year sensitivities.” The report said Smith’s team consulted regularly with the Public Integrity Section within the Justice Department, which oversees cases involving public officials, including on details like when to propose trial dates that wouldn’t interfere with the election. “Collectively, prosecutors in the Office had many years of experience providing training, advice, and guidance to prosecutors and law enforcement agents throughout the Department on how to comply with the Department’s election-related policies,” the report said. An appendix of the report contains a series of previously undisclosed, combative letters sent by Smith’s team and Trump’s lawyers as they wrangled in recent days over the public release of the report. Trump’s lawyers sent a letter to Garland on January 6, demanding that Smith “terminate all efforts towards the preparation and release of” his report. They claimed that Smith was trying to “perpetuate false and discredited accusations” against Trump by releasing the report, and they called him an “out-of-control private citizen unconstitutionally posing as a prosecutor,” citing US District Judge Aileen Cannon’s ruling that Smith’s appointment as special counsel was unlawful. Smith penned his own letter to Garland on January 7, rebutting the Trump letter. Smith’s response accuses Trump’s lawyers, including his nominee for deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, of making a “variety of false, misleading, or otherwise unfounded claims.” The special counsel also pointed out that Trump’s letter “fails to identify any specific factual objections to the draft” report that they reviewed in the past several weeks, ahead of its public release. “Mr. Trump recycles his baseless allegation that the Office’s work constituted a partisan attack, a claim flatly rejected by the only court to have ruled on it,” Smith wrote in the letter to Garland, referring to an August 2024 ruling from federal Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, DC, in the election subversion case. A hearing on volume two of Smith’s report is set for later this week in Florida. Garland does not intend to release that portion of the report publicly, but he had planned to allow a very small group of lawmakers to view it behind closed doors. Cannon, however, extended an order that prevents him from sharing that volume to anyone outside of the department. This story has been updated with additional details."
READ: Jack Smith’s report on efforts to overturn the 2020 election,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/politics/read-jack-smith-report-trump-2020-election/index.html,The Department of Justice early Tuesday released special counsel Jack Smith’s report on his investigation into Donald Trump and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

A guide to Pete Hegseth’s confirmation hearing,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/politics/hegseth-confirmation-hearing-defense-secretary/index.html,"Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon, will face a Senate panel Tuesday for his confirmation hearing as he is expected to be questioned over allegations ranging from sexual assault to excessive drinking in the workplace. Hegseth has denied all accusations and made several trips to Capitol Hill to shore up support since he was announced as Trump’s pick in November, including meeting with senators as recently as last week. But it’s unclear as of Tuesday whether the veteran and former Fox News host has managed to convince the Senate Armed Services Committee so that his nomination can be referred to the full chamber for a vote. Trump has defended his pick amid the allegations and in December said he remained confident that Hegseth will be confirmed. However, CNN has reported the Trump transition team has compiled a list of potential alternatives should Hegseth falter. Here’s what to know about Hegseth and his confirmation hearing. Hegseth is a decorated combat veteran who was deployed in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Iraq and Afghanistan. He has earned two Bronze Star Medals for his service in Iraq and Afghanistan. He went on to lead two veteran advocacy nonprofits, Vets for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America, and joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014, eventually becoming a co-host of the weekend “Fox & Friends” show. Trump considered Hegseth for a Cabinet position during his first term, including Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and though he was ultimately passed over, Hegseth remained in Trump’s orbit. He acted as an informal adviser to Trump for a number of years while he was in and out of office, Trump advisers told CNN. As a Fox News host, Hegseth made $4.6 million, according to his financial disclosure, which covered the past two years. He left the role in November amid his announcement as Trump’s pick for defense secretary. Hegseth also made approximately $1 million on speaking fees across dozens of engagements in 2023 and 2024, many of which were at conservative or Christian organizations, and brought in royalties from three books he has written. According to the financial disclosure, Hegseth held stock in several major defense contractors as well, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Honeywell. The value of the assets was relatively small, listed between $1,001 and $15,000 for each of the companies. Hegseth also held between $15,001 and $50,000 of Bitcoin. CNN has reported that as Hegseth’s public profile grew, he faced deepening private turmoil. His second wife, Samantha, filed for divorce in 2017, shortly after Fox executive producer Jennifer Rauchet — with whom he had been having an affair — gave birth to their baby. During divorce proceedings, a court-appointed parenting consultant chastised Hegseth in one letter for his conduct around his sons, writing that he had shown “hostile and degrading communication” toward Samantha. Hegseth stated in a court filing that he thought the court-appointed consultant’s letter was “heavy handed,” though he committed to learning from his mistakes. His attorney said that the proceedings were typical for divorce cases, noting that Hegseth has a great relationship with his kids and adding that “this is why people get divorced – because they fight.” Hegseth’s treatment of women was criticized by his own mother, who wrote in a 2018 letter obtained by The New York Times in late November that that there are “many” women whom he has “abused in some way” and encouraged him to “get some help.” Shortly after, Penelope Hegseth went on Fox News to retract the letter and defend her son, and she told the Times that she wrote the email “in anger, with emotion.” Pete Hegseth’s mother said that she had immediately apologized in a separate email, and she said her own characterization of his treatment of women in the email “has never been true.” Hegseth was accused by a woman of sexually assaulting her in October 2017 following a speaking engagement at a conference held by a Republican women’s group in Monterey, California. According to a police report obtained by CNN, the woman told police that Hegseth physically blocked her from leaving a hotel room, took her phone and then sexually assaulted her even though she “remembered saying ‘no’ a lot.” Hegseth told police that their encounter was consensual and that he had repeatedly made sure the woman “was comfortable with what was going on between the two of them.” Hegseth was not charged with a crime in connection with the allegation. In response to the reporting of the police report, his lawyer Tim Parlatore told CNN that the “police found the allegations to be false, which is why no charges were filed,”— although the report does not say that police found the allegations to be false. Hegseth continues to deny any wrongdoing and maintains that the encounter was consensual. Years later, he paid the woman as part of a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality clause. Hegseth’s lawyer said that he settled because he was worried it was during the “Me Too” movement and he didn’t want to lose his job at Fox News if the accusation became public. Hegseth has also been accused of mismanaging funds at Vets for Freedom, including inappropriate expenses such as parties one former associate of the group described as “trysts,” according to The New Yorker. During a later leadership stint at Concerned Veterans for America, former employees sent a letter to the nonprofit’s senior management with a slew of allegations related to excessive drinking and treatment of female staff, the magazine further reported. The magazine did not name the employees and CNN has not independently reviewed the report. Among the allegations were that Hegseth had to be restrained from joining the dancers on stage at a Louisiana strip club where he had brought his team. The complaint also alleged Hegseth’s management team “sexually pursued” employees and divided the organization’s female staffers into two groups — “party girls” and “not party girls.” He has also been accused of ignoring a female employee’s allegation that another member of Hegseth’s staff attempted to sexually assault her. The magazine also alleges that it obtained a letter that alleged Hegseth, in a separate incident, “passed out” in the back of a party bus and then urinated in front of a hotel where the organization’s team was staying. Responding to the New Yorker’s reporting, a Hegseth adviser said in a statement to CNN, “We’re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through the New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s.” One longtime Fox News producer told CNN years before Hegseth became Trump’s pick that his drinking habit was an “open secret” on the set of “Fox & Friends” and that he had more than once noticed beer cans in the trash inside Hegseth’s office. Hegseth has previously acknowledged that he was drinking heavily as he transitioned from military to civilian life, but he denies having a drinking problem and has vowed to quit drinking all together if he’s confirmed. Hegseth has on several occasions slammed the policies of the very department he could soon lead. He has criticized efforts to allow women into combat roles, accusing the military of lowering standards to allow women into those jobs. Hegseth said on a podcast last year that he took issue specifically with women in “physical, labor-intensive type jobs,” such as those with the Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, Army Special Forces, Marine Forces Special Operations and jobs such as those in infantry, armor and artillery units. On the same podcast, Hegseth also criticized the military’s diversity programs, saying, “Woke sh*t has got to go.” In his 2024 book “The War on Warriors” and in subsequent media promotions last year, he condemned policies allowing gay people to serve openly in the US military, calling them part of a “Marxist” agenda to prioritize social justice over combat readiness. During the widespread protests following George Floyd’s death in 2020, Hegseth supported ordering active-duty troops to put down riots. And like Trump, Hegseth has also praised waterboarding as an “effective” tactic. Hegseth also urged Trump to be tougher on some issues, such as pushing the then-president to take further action against Iran after the president ordered a drone strike in January 2020 that killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. Hegseth also spread baseless conspiracy theories about the US Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, claiming the initial break-in was a false flag operation carried out by leftist groups disguised as Trump supporters. As he continues to deny the mounting allegations, Hegseth has attempted to convince members of the key Senate Armed Services Committee and has vowed to “fight like hell” to win confirmation. Hegseth met with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week and sought to address any last-minute concerns ahead of Tuesday’s hearing. During similar meetings with senators last month, a senior transition official told CNN that Hegseth faced blunt questions from members and nearly every meeting included a discussion about the role of women in combat following reports of him supporting a ban on women from combat roles. In conversations with senators, Hegseth chose not to lean into controversial policies he has supported and instead conveyed that his aim is to “make this military lethal again,” the official said. Parlatore told CNN early last month that Hegseth’s name was submitted for an FBI background check, and subsequently shared that the confidentiality agreement with his accuser and the complaint from former employees at Concerned Veterans for America were submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Senate Armed Services Committee, chaired by GOP Sen. Roger Wicker, will question Hegseth during a confirmation hearing before voting on whether to advance his nomination for a full vote in the Senate. Wicker and Ranking Member Jack Reed, a Democrat, were briefed Friday night on the FBI’s background check of Hegseth, sources told CNN. Per the committee’s practices, other members of the committee will not receive a briefing. Hegseth will need to limit defections in the chamber to three GOP senators assuming all Democrats vote against him. A group of Democrats in the committee has argued that the allegations against Hegseth should disqualify him from leading the Pentagon. Committee member Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — who sent a 33-page letter to Hegseth outlining more than 70 questions that she and other Democrats have for him — argued that Hegseth is not qualified. “We need someone who will be sober, who is someone who has gained the respect and trust of the troops, and someone who has demonstrated that he can actually manage an organization — not just 40 people, which has been his experience — but that he’s really ready to take on an organization of 3.5 million people,” Warren told CNN last week. Meanwhile, key Republicans on the panel have signaled openness to backing Hegseth. Among the Republican members of the committee who were initially hesitant to back him was Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, a survivor of sexual assault who has advocated for women in the military and is seen as a key potential swing vote. After conversations with Hegseth last month — one of which Ernst described as “thoughtful” and policy-focused — the senator said the defense pick “is very supportive of women in the military,” despite his previous comments. However, while she said she will “support Pete through this process,” she would not comment on whether she feels confident with Hegseth’s denials over the sexual assault allegation. Trump has continued to back Hegseth, which sets up a challenge for any GOP senator who might go up against him. With Trump’s picks to face confirmation hearings soon, GOP senators are being careful to pick their battles and cautious of how they approach the president-elect’s selections."
US encounters European skepticism in last-ditch push to seize $300B in Russian assets for Ukraine leverage,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/politics/biden-russian-assets-ukraine-european-skepticism/index.html,"With just days left before handing over the keys to the US government, the Biden administration is making a last-ditch effort to seize hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian assets as future negotiating leverage for Ukraine, according to two senior administration officials. Top Biden aides have been working to convince European partners to support moving some $300 billion of Russian money into a new escrow account that would be released only as part of a peace deal. The money belongs to the Russian Central Bank and was initially frozen three years ago after Russia invaded Ukraine. Most of that money is still being held in European banks, though a fraction remains in banks based in the US. Seizing the assets would be meant to send a simple message to Moscow, one senior administration official told CNN: “If you want your money back, you’re going to have to come talk.” Senior Biden officials have consulted closely on the idea with President-elect Donald Trump’s national security team, including Sen. Marco Rubio, his secretary of state designee, and Rep. Mike Waltz, tapped for national security adviser. The Trump camp, according to people familiar with the matter, is generally supportive of the strategy, believing that the seized money could give Russia fresh incentive to come to the negotiating table, with Trump wanting to see a swift end to a war he believes has already gone on too long. The Europeans, however, are not as keen on the idea and have raised concerns about violating international law if banks confiscate Russia’s money outright. For more than a year, US officials have worked to ease those concerns and find a way to use the frozen Russian money in a way that could benefit Ukraine. In a deal that was seen as a compromise, G-7 countries agreed last year to use interest that had accrued from the frozen investments, which generate a return each year of about $5 billion, as a loan to Ukraine. The resulting $50 billion loan would be paid back by the investments’ profit over a decade. With just days to go before a transition of power in Washington, Europeans remain skeptical about confiscating the principle of the frozen Russian cash, sources told CNN, making it highly unlikely that any deal gets done before Trump assumes office. Senior US officials suggested that Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union party who is poised to become chancellor, is open to the idea of pursuing the strategy – but he hasn’t taken office. President Joe Biden had expected to discuss the issue with Italian leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a meeting in Rome this week, which the US cancelled as the most destructive fire in Los Angeles’ history raged across the city. Biden spoke by phone with Zelensky last Friday. It’s unclear if the topic of the Russian money came up. The White House has long been supportive of using the $300 billion in frozen Russian money to fund Ukraine’s reconstruction and increase Ukraine’s leverage. In recent meetings, Biden has personally broached the topic with G-7 leaders, a White House official said. In its final weeks, the Biden team has looked for other ways to bolster Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and its balance sheet ahead of Trump’s inauguration. The US last week announced new sanctions on secretive ships transporting Russian energy. That came a day after the White House said it would send a final tranche of $500 million worth of weapons, bringing the total amount of security aid for Ukraine to more than $65 billion. Biden officials have stressed that they want to leave the Trump administration with the strongest hand possible on Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference in Paris last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken again stressed that the outgoing administration wants to make sure that, if the Trump administration chooses to negotiate, that it would do so from a “position of strength and that President Trump could get the strongest possible deal.” Trump has repeatedly voiced his desire to quickly bring the war to a close. Blinken acknowledged that “we’re at a point in the coming year where it may be that the parties will choose to negotiate.” While the Biden administration has rushed to use as much of the money authorized by Congress to send to Ukraine, it will not have been able to disburse all of it before its term expires next week. There will be “just under $4 billion” in funding from the Presidential Drawdown Authority that will roll over from the outgoing Biden administration to the incoming Trump administration for funding aid to Ukraine, according to a Defense Department spokesperson. As for the G-7 loan program, the US committed $20 billion toward it and delivered its portion to the World Bank in December. But only $1 billion has been disbursed, with the rest to come on a World Bank schedule, according Ukrainian officials. To what extent the Trump administration could try to claw back the remainder if it hasn’t been delivered is a cause for concern among Ukrainian officials. The Kremlin called the $1 billion transfer theft and has repeatedly blasted the freezing of its assets. “This money was stolen from us, and the blocking of our assets is absolutely illegal, violating all norms and rules,” Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters last month. In a recent interview, Zelensky said he told Trump to instead give the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to them to cement the strength of the Ukrainian military as a kind of security guarantee that Ukraine would want for agreeing to end the war. “Take money, what we need for our interior production, and we will buy all the weapons from the United States,” Zelensky said. “We don’t need gifts from the United States. It will be very good for your industry, for the United States. We will put money there. Russian money, not Ukrainian, not European.”"
Judge Cannon OKs release of special counsel’s report into Trump and election subversion,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/politics/special-counsel-trump-january-6-report-judge-cannon/index.html,"Judge Aileen Cannon said Monday she would not block the release of special counsel Jack Smith’s report on his investigation into Donald Trump and efforts to overturn the 2020 election. However, Cannon scheduled a court hearing later this week on Attorney General Merrick Garland’s plan to share with some lawmakers the part of Smith’s report dealing with the classified documents probe. In the meantime, she is continuing to halt the department from disclosing that aspect of the report to anyone outside of the agency. Trump asked the judge late Monday to rethink her order clearing the way for the release of the portion dealing with the 2020 election probe, arguing it should remain on hold so that he could put forward his arguments for blocking the report’s entire release at the Friday hearing. Cannon rejected the Trump team’s last-minute attempt to delay the Justice Department’s release of the election subversion volume of the report, leaving an earlier hold on it to lift at midnight. The rebuff from the Trump-appointed judge marked the latest twist in a court fight that has upended the Justice Department’s preparations for winding down its investigations into Trump before he is sworn into office next week, while jeopardizing the transparency Congress and the public have into those probes. The department has historically released the final reports on special counsel investigations into presidents, including while those presidents were still in the White House. But as part of an unrelenting legal attack on Smith, Trump and his allies have delayed the publication of the January 6 volume of the report, which is not expected to break new ground factually, and has paused even limited disclosure of the report on the classified documents investigation. Trump has chosen multiple members of his personal defense teams for roles in his incoming administration. Cannon, according to Monday’s order, is continuing to halt the department’s release of the report’s classified documents volume because she “is not willing to make that gamble on the basis of generalized interest by members of Congress, at least not without full briefing and a hearing on the subject.” Garland had planned to allow the Republicans and Democrats who lead the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to review the report privately on the condition that they do not disclose information from it. Garland has said he will publicly release the special counsel report into Trump and the 2020 election aftermath before Trump takes office next Monday. The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The previous order Cannon placed blocking release of both volumes was set to expire at midnight going into Tuesday, allowing the department to release the 2020 election case volume then. The 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals had already rejected the Trump team’s earlier request to block the report’s publication. After Cannon’s initial order, Trump said on social media that Smith was “was illegitimately involved in this political persecution, and all of the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by our hapless government were, simply put, wasted!” In the election subversion case, Smith alleged that Trump and several unindicted co-conspirators undertook a multi-stage scheme to attack the peaceful transfer of power, culminating in the January 2021 assault on the US Capitol by Trump’s supporters. The case was stymied by a Supreme Court ruling last summer and ultimately dropped after Election Day. In the Mar-a-Lago documents case, Trump was charged with mishandling national defense information he took with him from his first turn in the White House. He was also accused of obstructing the federal probe into the documents’ whereabouts, as were to of his two employees, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. The defense lawyers argued that Cannon’s decision last summer finding Smith was unconstitutionally appointed prevented Garland from releasing the report for both special counsel investigations. Because the appointments ruling is currently on appeal, raising the possibility the prosecution could be revived, the Trump employees also argue that releasing report could prejudice them as defendants. Trump was dismissed from the case after his reelection. This story has been updated with additional developments."
Special counsel who investigated Hunter Biden criticizes President Biden in final report,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/politics/hunter-biden-david-weiss-special-counsel-report/index.html,"The Justice Department special counsel whose six-year case into Hunter Biden was short-circuited last month by the unconditional pardon President Joe Biden granted to his son, criticized the outgoing president in his final report Monday. Special counsel David Weiss chastised President Biden as part of the 280-page report for making “gratuitous and wrong” accusations that his long-running investigation was unfair and tainted by politics. The president, when pardoning his son last month, had said Hunter Biden was the victim of a “selective” prosecution that was “unfair” and a “miscarriage of justice.” “Other presidents have pardoned family members, but in doing so, none have taken the occasion as an opportunity to malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations,” Weiss said in the report. “Far from selective, these prosecutions were the embodiment of the equal application of justice – no matter who you are, or what your last name is, you are subject to the same laws as everyone else in the United States,” he added. The report stated that “politicians who attack the decisions of career prosecutors as politically motivated when they disagree with the outcome of a case undermine the public’s confidence in our criminal justice system. The President’s statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith.” Weiss also quoted the federal judge who presided over Hunter Biden’s tax case, who rebuked the president on similar grounds after he issued the blanket pardon, accusing him of “rewriting history.” CNN has previously reported on the false and inaccurate claims that Joe Biden made in an interview with USA Today earlier this month to justify the pardon. Some of those claims about the facts of Hunter Biden’s gun case were contradicted by the evidence and testimony at trial. The president’s pardon shielded his son from any prosecution stemming from any federal crimes he may have committed between 2014 and December 2024. Therefore, “in light of this pardon,” Weiss said he didn’t include any legal analysis in his report about “whether additional charges were warranted” beyond the 12 tax and gun crimes he charged Hunter Biden with in 2023. In a statement Monday, Hunter Biden’s lawyer Abbe Lowell﻿ said, “What is clear from this report is that the investigation into Hunter Biden is a cautionary tale of the abuse of prosecutorial power.” Lowell blasted several of Weiss’ key decisions, including his attempt in 2023 to wind down the probe with a negotiated plea agreement. That deal – which would’ve averted a trial – imploded after scrutiny from a federal judge and top Republican lawmakers. “Mr. Weiss also fails to explain why he reneged on his own agreement, a reversal that came at the 11th hour in court as he and his office faced blistering attacks from Republicans,” he said. Weiss had investigated Hunter Biden since 2018, when he was the Donald Trump-appointed US attorney for Delaware. After Joe Biden became president, he kept Weiss to finish his work, even while replacing almost all other US attorneys, as is common. Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated Weiss to “special counsel” in 2023, after the proposed Hunter Biden plea deal fell apart in court. In an opening note at the beginning of the report, Weiss thanked Garland for “allowing (his) Office to conduct its investigations and prosecutions independently.”  The note pushes back on GOP allegations that Garland, a Biden appointee, had meddled in the probe to protect the Bidens. Weiss charged two people during the course of his investigation: Hunter Biden and Alexander Smirnov, a former FBI informant who falsely accused Hunter and his father of taking $10 million in bribes from Ukraine. House Republicans used those claims to bolster their failed impeachment push. Smirnov was sentenced last week to six years in prison. During Weiss’ investigation, he made history by becoming the first prosecutor in American history to file criminal charges against the son of a sitting president. Hunter Biden was convicted by a jury on three counts related to his unlawful purchase and possession of a gun while abusing illicit drugs. Weiss also brought a nine-count federal tax indictment against Biden, who pleaded guilty on what was supposed to be the first day of his trial in September. He admitted to tax evasion, filing false tax returns, and failing to file and pay his taxes on time. Hunter Biden was never sentenced for those crimes, because he was pardoned by his father after the November election, short-circuiting the court process. The Weiss special counsel investigation has been fraught with allegations of politicization from both sides of the aisle. He has previously denied that his work was hampered by any political interference. The Biden family and some Democrats have accused Weiss of unfairly targeting Hunter Biden and doing Trump’s bidding, caving to his demands to indict Hunter Biden. But many Republicans argued that Weiss went soft on Hunter Biden and offered him a “sweetheart deal” that would’ve swept his crimes under the rug, if it hadn’t fallen apart. In the report, Weiss said he “ignored” politicians who repeatedly weighed in on his investigation of Hunter Biden and focused instead on “the facts and the law” while prosecuting the president’s son. “I also never considered whether my decisions would be viewed favorably or unfavorably by any politicians,” Weiss wrote. “And when politicians expressed opinions about my conduct, I ignored them because they were irrelevant. Simply put, my decisions were based on the facts and the law and nothing else.” Despite the fact that figures from both political parties hammered Weiss at various points of his probe, his report only rebuked Joe Biden by name for his commentary about the probe. The report does not mention the congressional Republicans who called for Weiss’ resignation, tried to upend the plea agreement he negotiated with Hunter Biden in 2023, held hearings with ex-IRS investigators who said his probe was filled with misconduct, and pressured the FBI to release documents about an now-debunked tip from an informant that the Bidens took massive bribes from Ukraine. The report contains about 30 pages of new material and about 250 pages of court filings that were previously part of the public record of Hunter Biden’s gun and tax cases. Ironically, Weiss said one of the reasons he prosecuted Hunter Biden for gun crimes was because President Biden’s administration prioritized gun control and stiffened penalties for some gun offenses. “I considered the federal law enforcement priorities, including any federal law enforcement initiatives or operations aimed at accomplishing those priorities,” Weiss said, pointing to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that Biden signed into law in 2022, and various Biden-era gun control actions at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. For years, Republicans have pushed unproven accusations that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden engaged in illegal overseas business dealings. Weiss said in the report released Monday that Hunter Biden “had no co-conspirators” in his financial crimes, which prosecutors investigated from 2018 to 2024. While Weiss was speaking narrowly about the specific federal tax charges he filed against Hunter Biden, his report is another reminder that prosecutors never accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing and never backed up GOP claims that Joe Biden engaged in illegal influence-peddling schemes with his son.

California Democrats get an early taste of new clashes with Trump as wildfires rage on,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/politics/democrats-trump-clash-california-wildfires/index.html,"President-elect Donald Trump launched a new round of criticism Sunday targeting Democrats over their efforts to tame the Southern California wildfires, ripping rival liberal leaders as “incompetent” witnesses to “one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country.” Trump’s Truth Social post is the latest in a series of attacks by the president-elect and his allies on California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. The Democrats already face tough questions from their constituents and other elected officials — including those from their own party and, increasingly, one another. But the broadsides from Trump and supporters such as billionaire Elon Musk — several of them misleading or citing erroneous reports — are setting the stage for fights to come between the president-elect and liberal cities and states ahead of his inauguration next week. The push-and-pull recalls some of the touchy, high-stakes interactions between Trump and top Democrats during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when leaders of liberal-leaning cities and states often pulled their political punches over concerns about alienating the first Trump White House and delaying federal support. Newsom is no stranger to clashes with Trump, but the crisis sweeping Los Angeles now presents a unique and more urgent challenge. The governor, considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate, expressed frustration with Trump’s rhetoric, but also has invited him to come and survey the damage “to meet with the Americans affected by these fires, see the devastation firsthand, and join me and others in thanking the heroic firefighters and first responders who are putting their lives on the line.” The softer approach followed a more pointed response from the California leader during an interview last week with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, during which he sounded deeply frustrated by Trump’s commentary. “People are literally fleeing. People have lost their lives. Kids lost their schools. Families completely torn asunder, churches burned down,” Newsom said. “This guy wanted to politicize it.” He paused again, then added, “I have a lot of thoughts, and I know what I want to say. “I won’t.” Republicans have been less hesitant to cast blame in California, especially on Bass, who was in Ghana for an official visit when the first fire in the Pacific Palisades broke out. They are increasingly seeking to wield the disaster as a cudgel against Democrats, particularly the leaders of big, liberal-voting cities and states. GOP critics’ argument boils down to a claim — most often asserted with little or no real evidence — that Democrats were blind to the risks of a catastrophic wildfire outbreak and ill-prepared to combat it because of their focus on pushing liberal ideological policies. “The far left policies of Democrats in California are literally burning us to the ground. Stop voting for people who won’t use common sense water management and forest policies. I’m pissed off. You should be, too,” Richard Grenell, Trump’s incoming “envoy for special missions,” posted on X last week. Musk retweeted the message, which has become a rallying cry of sorts from many national Republicans — especially Trump’s most aggressive MAGA allies, many of whom have attacked Newsom and Bass over land and water management issues, often exaggerating or in some cases fabricating damning details of a mixture of scientific and bureaucratic processes. Newsom and Bass are both plainly angered by the criticism, and keen to push back, but also realize that, in a little more than a week, they will rely on the president-elect for immediate and long-term funding for what figures to be a yearslong rebuilding process. The issue has even penetrated reliably pro-Trump outlets like Fox News. Vice President-elect JD Vance on Sunday morning was asked directly, during an interview on the network, whether the incoming administration might withhold aid from California — a state Kamala Harris won in the 2024 presidential election by more than 20 percentage points, or roughly 3.2 million votes. “President Trump cares about all Americans,” Vance replied, pivoting to a criticism of President Joe Biden’s response. “(Trump) is the president for all Americans, and I think that he intends to have FEMA and other federal responses, much, much better and much more clued into what’s going on there on the ground.” The uncertainty surrounding Trump’s plans for Los Angeles after he returns to office in eight days has been a topic of conversation in recent news conferences with city leaders. Bass on Sunday said that while she has not spoken directly to the president-elect, there has been constructive engagement with some members of his incoming administration. “I joined in the invitation to the incoming President to come to Los Angeles. I joined with the supervisor and the governor. Spoke directly with the incoming administration yesterday,” Bass said. “It was a fine call.” The wind-born firestorms tearing through historic oceanside neighborhoods; the Hollywood Hills; and, farther inland, communities in the San Gabriel Valley, like Altadena and Pasadena have resulted in evacuation orders for about more than 100,000 Angelenos, destroyed homes and, by Sunday, killed 24 people, according to officials. Disaster relief from Washington, DC, where Biden remains after canceling a trip to Italy, is being surged into the region and Bass on Friday said the Federal Emergency Management Agency has pledged to recoup every dime of the city’s fire-fighting expenses. As Democrats struggle to strike a balance with Trump, a little-known — outside Los Angeles — California Republican has emerged as perhaps the most competent communicator, to the public and to Trump, of anyone squaring up to the press and news cameras every few hours. Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, a Republican, has been cheered by some in the city for her dispatches and updates on local and national news programs. On Saturday, she did what many Democrats are loath to do — dress up a request for help from Trump in congratulatory, flattering terms. In a letter, Barger first praised Trump for his 2018 response to the Woolsey Fire, which hit the Santa Monica area during his first term. After extending a “formal invitation” for Trump to visit the affected areas in Los Angeles, Barger effectively spelled out the political upside of engaging with local leaders. “By accepting this invitation, Mr. President-Elect, you will join us in supporting our citizenry and thanking our heroic first responders, who have risked their own lives to save others,” she wrote. “We would also ask you, as our President, to stand with the people of Los Angeles County as we set our course to rebuild. Your presence would be deeply felt and appreciated.” A day after sending the letter, Barger offered a pledge to Angelenos affected by the fires. “I’m going to see this through with you,” Barger said at a news conference. “We will not let up using every resource to fight existing fires. Displaced residents will be served to the highest level as we address your housing, welfare, health care and economic needs.” Democrats have offered similar messages to the city and the victims of the fires, but those statements have been overshadowed in some cases, most notably in the last 48 hours, by thinly veiled efforts to spare themselves blame for shortcomings in the government response. Newsom, in an interview released Saturday with the liberal “Pod Save America,” pointed a finger at local leaders, suggesting he was not given “straight answers” about the situation from the outset. “I’m the governor of California and want to know the answer. I’ve got that question, I can’t tell you, by how many people, ‘What happened?’ — on my own team, ‘What happened?’” Newsom said. He added, “I’ll be candid with you, I wasn’t getting straight answers.” On Sunday, Newsom sought to get back on the front foot, signing an executive order suspending some requirements to build under state environmental laws to help fire victims rebuild faster. “California leads the nation in environmental stewardship. I’m not going to give that up, but one thing I won’t give into is delay,” Newsom told NBC News, promising regulatory red-tape would not slow the recovery process. The governor has also called for an independent investigation into problems with local water supply after reports that the Santa Ynez Reservoir was empty as the wildfires first struck, further hampering firefighting efforts in the Pacific Palisades. California Sen. Adam Schiff backed the proposal and, during an interview with ABC News on Sunday, suggested the state “go further” and “do an independent commission review of all of this.” This story has been updated with new reporting."
Carrie Underwood slated to perform at Trump’s inauguration,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/politics/carrie-underwood-slated-to-perform-at-trump-inauguration/index.html,"Country music star Carrie Underwood is slated to perform “America the Beautiful” at President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, according to a copy of the program obtained by CNN and confirmed by a spokesperson for the inaugural committee. “I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,” Underwood said in a statement to CNN.  “I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.” The presidential oath of office will be administered by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts with Justice Brett Kavanaugh expected to administer the oath of office to Vice President-elect JD Vance. Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president of the United States will take place on January 20 at the US Capitol. Underwood is a big get for Trump’s inauguration, considering Hollywood’s Trump blackout over the course of his political career. In his first term and throughout the past three elections, Trump has struggled to garner support from major Hollywood stars. At the Republican National Convention last year, the two biggest stars onstage with Trump were musician Kid Rock and retired WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan – a far cry from a superstar at the height of their career, like Underwood. The Grammy-winning artist is as high-profile as you can get in country music, not only with numerous platinum hits, but also with public-facing, mainstream business associations. Underwood is the face of Sunday Night Football and is set to make her debut this March as a judge on ABC’s “American Idol” – the singing competition show that catapulted her to fame when she won in 2005. While many NFL fans will likely applaud Underwood for singing at the inauguration, any time a celebrity aligns themselves with Trump, they run the risk of alienating left-leaning fans and Hollywood allies. Underwood has kept her politics under wraps over the course of her career. In her statement, she did not mention Trump by name and kept her focus on unifying the country – still, Underwood’s decision to publicly align with Trump is a big statement for any star, particularly one as private as the singer. Historically, Hollywood has always been closely associated with the Democratic Party, but country stars have always been an outlier, leaning more conservative. In recent years, as new singers join the genre, country music has gotten to be more progressive. This past election cycle, country stars like Mickey Guyton and Maren Morris stood with Vice President Kamala Harris."
Trump’s Cabinet picks face scrutiny on Capitol Hill this week as Biden prepares to say goodbye,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/politics/trump-cabinet-confirmation-hearings-biden-farewell/index.html,"Donald Trump is roaring up to speed seven days before his return to the Oval Office, while Joe Biden seeks last-ditch hostage deals as his administration says goodbye in the last week of his term. A flurry of Senate confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet picks, beginning Tuesday, will exemplify the president-elect’s aggressive efforts to wield swift and consequential power after taking the oath of office on January 20. Trump will also make fresh efforts this week to nail down the strategy to push his sweeping agenda of disruption through the narrowly divided House and Senate before he launches a weekend of celebrations ahead of the inauguration. Biden, 82, will deliver his farewell speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday in his first such address since he told Americans he wouldn’t run for reelection in July after a disastrous debate laid bare his diminished capacity. The outgoing administration is still hoping for a deal that would free US and Israeli hostages in Gaza, and Biden is also pushing the Taliban for the release of three Americans the US considers unjustly held in Afghanistan. The president is also still considering whether to grant preemptive pardons to people whom the White House believes may be targets of the next president’s retribution, such as former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the president-elect’s most prominent GOP critics. Biden said Friday he was watching Trump’s rhetoric to try to assess his intentions, at a time when the departing president is using his appearances to try to fashion last-minute adjustments to how he will be remembered in history. An already tense transition, given the brittle personal relationship between Trump and Biden, will be further overshadowed by the disastrous wildfires that have destroyed thousands of homes in the Los Angeles area and killed at least 24 people. The tragedy will become the first crisis that Trump must manage as soon as he becomes president. But he’s already flinging blame toward Democratic leaders in California and misinformation about the cause of the fires. Angelenos desperately needing billions of dollars in federal aid will be in a delicate position as their Democratic-run city and state deals with a GOP White House and Congress determined to slash spending. Trump on Sunday blamed “incompetent pols” for what he said was one of America’s “worst catastrophes,” saying in a Truth Social posting at 1:24 a.m., “They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?” One of Trump’s most prominent Democratic antagonists, California Sen. Adam Schiff, said on Sunday said he hoped Trump would not use wildfire aid as political leverage against his state. “We’re all in this together. It’s the United States of America. We need the incoming president to view it that way,” Schiff said on ABC’s “This Week.” Trump’s Cabinet choices, who reflect his desire for total loyalty, are a stunning statement of intent from a president-elect who wants to apply shock treatment to government agencies but was often constrained by establishment forces during his first term. This week will begin to show whether Republican senators will be willing to reject any more of Trump’s picks after balking at former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz as his initial selection for attorney general. One of the most contentious picks is Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News anchor whom Trump wants as defense secretary. Critics say he’s unqualified for a vital national security role. And the Iraq and Afghan war veteran has faced sexual assault and personal misconduct allegations, which he denies. Hegseth will appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday with all eyes on Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican who initially voiced concerns about the pick but who met Hegseth several times and secured assurances on one of her key issues — women serving in combat. Two other Cabinet picks, Douglas Collins for the Department of Veterans Affairs and former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum for the Department of the Interior, also have hearings Tuesday. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told his caucus last week that the confirmation hearings offer a chance for Democrats to hold Trump picks’ “feet to the fire” and to set the table to later tell Americans, “We warned you,” CNN’s Morgan Rimmer reported on Sunday. Trump, who was last week sentenced to an unconditional discharge in his New York hush money case — a step that nevertheless ensured he will enter office officially as an convicted felon — warned during the campaign that he will turn the Justice Department against his enemies. This will make the confirmation hearing for Pam Bondi, his fallback pick for attorney general, especially critical. The hearing, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, could be an early indication of how far the Justice Department’s nominal independence from the White House will be eroded during the second Trump term. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, whom Trump chose to run the Department of Homeland Security, will also have a hearing on Wednesday, among several other Trump picks. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for secretary of state, also faces a hearing but may have an easier ride among his colleagues than some Trump selections. The comparison between Trump’s approaching presidency and Biden’s final days in power will be played out in a series of valedictory addresses. On Monday, the president will visit the State Department to put a capstone on a foreign policy marked by his staunch support of Ukraine against an illegal Russian invasion. Meanwhile, Trump is preparing to alleviate Russian President Vladimir Putin’s pariah status with a summit early in his second presidency. Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday that US alliances were in better shape, NATO was stronger, and America’s adversaries were weaker than when Biden took over from Trump in 2021. Biden’s team is still locked in intense talks in Qatar designed to finally force a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, and the president spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday. Israeli officials have expressed cautious optimism about the talks and the Biden and Trump teams have been closely coordinating after Trump warned there “would be hell to pay” if the hostages aren’t let free by the time he becomes president. Sullivan told Tapper on “State of the Union” that “we are very, very close.” But he added, “Being very close still means we’re far, because, until you actually get across the finish line, we’re not there.” The administration is also pursuing the release of Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann and Mahmoud Habibi, who have been held by the Taliban since 2022. The president spoke with the families of the three men on Sunday, and Roger Carstens, the top US hostage envoy was in Doha, Qatar, last week to pursue a breakthrough. CNN’s Jenny Hansler reported last week the US offered to trade a Guantanamo Bay prisoner, Muhammad Rahim al Afghani, who is alleged to have been a “close associate” of Osama bin Laden, for the men. Biden’s focus on foreign and national security policy this week is a reminder that he repeatedly told world leaders after defeating Trump in 2020 that “America is back.” Yet he’ll soon hand the White House to his nemesis, in a show of respect for the tradition of transfer of power that his predecessor, and now successor, denied him after his supporters rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. This entire week will, therefore, be a reminder that Biden will fail to secure his hoped-for legacy of ushering Trump into history. Instead, he will yield power to a man whom he considers a threat to the nation’s soul."
Montana elected a firefighter to the Senate. He’s already pushing for solutions,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/tim-sheehy-wildfire-legislation-what-matters/index.html,"With wildfires fires ravaging Los Angeles, the firefighter-turned-senator from Montana wants to fight bureaucracy. Less than a week into his new job, Montana Republican Tim Sheehy is finding plenty of use for his previous experience as an aerial firefighter and wildfire entrepreneur as he pushes for new legislation to address the new reality of a fire season that never ends. “There’s a huge dichotomy in America between structural firefighting — the red fire truck, traditional firemen everyone’s familiar with — and wildland firefighting,” Sheehy told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Thursday, adding that the country needs more money to fight wildfires and to cut past wildlife protections when flames are raging. “The entire wildfire community has been speaking for years, shouting from the rooftops that this big one was going to be coming, and we’re not ready,” he said. That big one is now here in Los Angeles, he said. Scientists and activists alarmed by the climate crisis have also been talking about the likelihood of a never-ending fire season, although Sheehy did not mention the climate. But the new reality of fire season is beyond dispute. “There’s no fire season in California. It’s year-round,” Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. Sheehy echoed that sentiment when he told Collins, “It’s a year-round threat. It’s a 50-state threat.” The fires are still raging in LA, but already Sheehy is working with Sens. Adam Schiff of California and Andy Kim of New Jersey, both Democrats whose states have suffered from wildfires, on new legislation. “This can be a bipartisan solution,” Sheehy said, adding that he, Schiff and Kim don’t see eye to eye on a lot things, but on this, they can work together. CNN reached out to Kim’s and Schiff’s offices to inquire about their priorities for a piece of wildfire preparedness legislation. With his bona fides and the support of President-elect Donald Trump, Sheehy said there is speedy movement toward a new law. “We’re going to try to start making these changes immediately, and punch through the bureaucracy. Because we have brave firefighters out there on the ground, and they need the right amount of support, and they’re not getting it,” Sheehy told Collins. He said there will need to be a focus on how states like California have approached water. “You’ve been seeing a lot of criticism of the California government, and other entities in the government, not unfairly, about the restriction of water use,” Sheehy said. Trump is among those who have criticized California’s government for its approach to water management, although, as CNN’s Daniel Dale noted, the president-elect’s arguments about the availability of water were not entirely rooted in reality. Officials in Los Angeles have said it is the scale of multiple fires being fought simultaneously that sapped hydrants of pressure when it was needed most, but there will certainly be an accounting to determine why, exactly, the system ran dry. As he tries to lead the way to a new law, Sheehy said it needs to include a readiness requirement to respond to a wildfire. “It can take hours. It can take days, before an aircraft or a fire truck can respond to a wildland fire,” he said. “We have to reform that. That’s No. 1.” His second priority would be to make the national wildfire apparatus a year-round operation. “We treat these firefighters, who are brave first responders, we treat them like seasonal ski resort employees. They get underpaid, they don’t get benefits, they don’t get medical care, if they get injured on the job. … We do our best for our troops. Wildland firefighters don’t get any of that,” he said. There have been efforts to increase funding for firefighters in recent years. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed by President Joe Biden in 2021 allocated billions of dollars to raise wages for firefighters. The Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats the following year also included funding to mitigate the risk of wildfires. The Los Angeles disaster could create momentum to do much more. Spending more money could be difficult at the outset of the Trump administration since Republicans are entering office with promises to cut government spending, not increase it. In a December op-ed for Fox News, Sheehy argued that the government efficiency effort being led by businessmen Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy presents an opportunity to improve wildfire response by putting a focus on the private sector’s ability to respond to fires. “The private sector always has and always will produce new innovations and better results faster and cheaper than the government. The same holds true in wildfire response. We must embrace this truth. Fostering stronger public-private partnerships with the wildland fire industry is essential,” Sheehy wrote. It’s important to note here that some of Sheehy’s personal wealth comes in part from the aerial firefighting company he founded and used to lead, Bridger Aerospace, which relies on government contracts to help fight wildfires. The young company has struggled financially and, during Sheehy’s Senate campaign, questions were raised about a $160 million public bond Gallatin County in Montana backed to help the private enterprise. Sheehy resigned as CEO in July during his Senate bid. Musk’s Tesla and SpaceX have also relied on public backing to build wealth. Sheehy told Collins that fires put millionaires and billionaires out on the street alongside the poor. “They’re going to burn our houses the same way,” he said. “Let’s get ready.”"
Trump endures embarrassment of criminal sentencing just 10 days before taking office,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/trump-sentencing-embarrassment-analysis/index.html,"The Supreme Court didn’t help Donald Trump … this time. The court’s 5-4 decision Thursday to deny the president-elect’s last-minute effort to delay sentencing in his New York hush money case set up a stunning moment in court on Friday morning, just 10 days before Trump will be sworn in for a second term. Judge Juan Merchan had already said he wouldn’t impose a jail term, and in sentencing Trump on Friday morning to an unconditional discharge, he noted the unique circumstances. “To be sure, it is the legal protections afforded to the office of the president of the United States that are extraordinary, not the occupant of the office,” Merchan said, noting that those protections “do not reduce the seriousness of the crime.” The hearing underscored that Trump will be the first president to take office with a criminal conviction written into his official record. The proximity of the sentencing to Trump’s inauguration creates a stunning juxtaposition. A defendant who was subject to the authority of a judge and a jury verdict will within days assume the vast powers of the presidency and become the ultimate guardian of the nation’s laws and the Constitution. “Despite the extraordinary breadth of those protections, one power they do not provide is the power to erase a jury verdict,” Merchan said. “Donald Trump, the ordinary citizen, Donald Trump, the criminal defendant, would not be entitled to such considerable protections.” The word “unprecedented” has been worn into a cliche by the unbelievable twists and turns of Trump’s life, his presidential campaigns and first White House term. But he made another head-spinning slice of history on Friday, after a campaign in which he defied four criminal indictments to win a second term. Trump did not appear in person but joined virtually from his home in Florida, from which he addressed the court, showing zero contrition and calling the case “a very terrible experience” and saying, “I’m totally innocent.” Trump’s remarks before the court were a familiar litany of grievances and attacks on everyone involved in the case. “It’s been a political witch hunt. It was done to damage my reputation, so that I’d lose the election and obviously that didn’t work. And the people of our country got to see this first-hand,” Trump said, “and then they voted and I won.” Despite fighting to block the hearing, Trump’s legal team believes it’s a significant victory, that after being convicted of 34 felonies, their client will only get an unconditional discharge, which is less than the penalty for a speeding ticket, a source familiar with their thinking told CNN’s Paula Reid. The lawyers also see the sentencing as “checking a box” so that they can appeal his conviction, the source said. But the defeat at the Supreme Court that allowed the sentencing to go forward was a rare reversal for Trump’s strategy of seeking to delay his criminal cases with multiple appeals – which he used in his federal cases to buy time until he could use his executive authority to thwart them. Of course, for this to work he had to live up to his end of the bargain and win the election. Had the Supreme Court ruled the other way on this case, it would have emboldened critics who argue the court facilitated Trump’s attempts to delay accountability after taking weeks to rule on his claims of sweeping immunity last year and then awarding him significant protection for official acts. That decision slowed the federal cases, allowing him to succeed in preventing trials from taking place before the election. Thursday’s ruling – in which two conservatives sided with liberal justices – may in some small measure reassure those who believed that the court’s decisions had challenged the idea that every American, no matter their position in life, is equal before the law. But it will not quell the widespread anxiety among liberals that the conservative majority Trump built in his first term will show considerable deference to the commander in chief in a second administration that may test the rule of law and the Constitution more than his first. The president-elect also attacked Merchan after the Supreme Court’s decision came down Thursday evening. “We’re going to appeal anyway, just psychologically, because frankly it’s a disgrace. It’s a judge that shouldn’t have been on the case,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago club. “So I’ll do my little thing tomorrow, they can have fun with their political opponent … this is a long way from finished.” The president-elect registered fury and disbelief about his plight during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago earlier this week, when he seemed preoccupied with the looming sentencing’s impact on his dignity. “I’m the president-elect of the United States of America. I’m a former, very successful president,” Trump said, complaining that he was a victim of a “judge working real hard to try and embarrass” him. Trump may not have needed any more incentive to use his powers as president to avenge what he claims is the weaponization of justice against him. But the sentencing could freshen his sense of grievance just before he takes power. Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records over payments to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen to reimburse a $130,000 hush money payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels in order to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair before the 2016 election. Trump pleaded not guilty in the case and has denied the affair. The two conservatives who joined the liberals were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed by Trump in his first term. Roberts will see Trump face-to-face on Inauguration Day on January 20 as he’s expected to preside over the swearing in. Four other conservatives would have granted Trump’s request to delay sentencing, including Justice Samuel Alito, who faced Democratic calls to recuse himself after a recent phone call with Trump on what he said was an unrelated matter. The majority held that neither of the grounds for a stay had merit, saying that Trump’s complaints about alleged evidentiary violations could be handled in the ordinary course of his appeals. It also disregarded the claim of Trump’s lawyers that sentencing would impose a burden on his responsibilities as president-elect. In another unusual twist in a staggering legal saga, Trump has picked two of his lawyers who filed the appeal to the top bench, Todd Blanche and D. John Sauer, to serve as deputy attorney general and solicitor general, respectively, in his new administration. The hush money case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was long regarded as the weakest of the four criminal matters that Trump faced in the run-up to the election, but it was the only one to reach a conclusion. Thursday’s decision may not end Trump’s business before a Supreme Court that has repeatedly been called into action to address the constitutional questions raised during and after a first administration that shattered norms of presidential conduct. That’s because the president-elect lost another legal battle on Thursday after a federal appeals court declined to block the Justice Department from releasing Smith’s final investigative report. The 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals left a three-day hold on the DOJ’s release of the report, which could allow time for more appeals. Trump is expected, yet again, to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in. This story and headline have been updated to reflect Trump’s sentencing Friday morning."
Carter’s funeral captures the American story at a fraught political moment,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/politics/president-jimmy-carter-funeral-service/index.html,"The nation would love to know what on Earth Donald Trump and Barack Obama were talking about. A prolonged, jovial exchange between the bitter enemies encapsulated the compelling theater of the state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter — 11 days before the 45th president is inaugurated as the 47th. The service, in Washington’s National Cathedral, was a paean for a humble man from a tiny Georgia town who rose to great power — a peanut farmer, nuclear physicist, submariner, husband, father, civil rights pioneer, president and Nobel laureate who died, at age 100, last month. But it was also a multi-layered melodrama of the nation’s fraught political moment, with vicious rivalries leavened for an hour or so by the dignity of mourning. In a rare spectacle, the fraternity of former presidents was all together. The cathedral’s front two rows contained the tumultuous stories, feuds and frictions of the last 30 years when American politics tore the nation apart. Last to arrive was President Joe Biden, holding hands with first lady Jill Biden, in one of the last official acts of his presidency. The first couple sat with Vice President Kamala Harris, who failed in her bid to succeed him, and her stone-faced husband Douglas Emhoff. Behind Biden, and just to the left, was Trump, who effectively ended his career in their sole debate, which exposed the president’s diminished capacity. Trump then ended Harris’ 2024 White House dreams. Behind Harris sat Hillary Clinton, whom Trump also kept from becoming the first woman president and breaking the hardest, highest ceiling in American politics. The former secretary of state, New York senator and first lady was with her husband Bill Clinton, now the last living president of the 20th century. There was a palpable sense of a political era closing since almost all of Carter’s foreign counterparts in his presidency, which lasted just one term from 1977 to 1981, are already long gone. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau – a frequent Trump target who just announced his resignation – offered one link to the past. He is the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who was prime minister for much of Carter’s presidency. Clinton sat next to former President George W. Bush on a rare visit to Washington for the Republican. Bush offered another parable of the passage of time. Now 78, he lacks the fiddly, towel-snapping energy of his 2000 campaign. You can take the boy out of the frat but not the frat out of the boy; Bush greeted his successor, Obama, with a manly belly tap. Obama got what his fellow presidents might consider the short straw — the spot next to Trump. But he didn’t take refuge in conversation with former first lady Laura Bush to his right. He was soon smiling broadly as he chatted with the incoming president, whom he campaigned vigorously against last fall. Obama is a gracious man, and people who have spent time with Trump say that despite his public spite, he’s entertaining and funny in private. So maybe they were just yukking it up. But their history and open public disdain made their interaction one of the most extraordinary moments in a vicious political age. After all, Trump rose to power with a racist and false conspiracy about Obama’s birthplace, and he still casts aspersions on the 44th president’s nationality and faith by pointing out his middle name is Hussein at rallies. Obama sees Trump as the antithesis of everything for which America stands. Only a few months ago, at the Democratic National Convention, he lampooned Trump as a “78-year-old billionaire who hasn’t stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.” He lambasted “the childish nicknames, the crazy conspiracy theories, this weird obsession with crowd sizes” and compared Trump to a neighbor who runs his leaf blower outside your window. “From a neighbor, that’s exhausting. From a president, it’s just dangerous.” There’s still no love lost. But since the last 15 years have been a duel between Obamaism and Trumpism, perhaps the country can take solace that they can still at least talk to one another. As to the subject of their conversation — who knows? Perhaps it was golf, which may be the only obsession they share. There was one notable absence from the ranks of the first families: Michelle Obama, who may find public magnanimity more difficult than her husband and branded Trump a misogynistic racist in her own Democratic convention speech. Behind the presidents were the vice presidents, Dan Quayle, Al Gore and Mike Pence, who greeted Trump with a stilted handshake that was a legacy of their split when the once-and-future president tried to steal the 2020 election. There was a poignant moment when Pence and Gore — two vice presidents who chose the Constitution and put the country first to move on from disputed elections — stood and chatted. The indignities and thwarted ambitions of the number twos were on display after the presidents left the service first with VIP treatment and the VEEPs were left waiting to exit with the rest of the public. They were stuck in the third pew of the cathedral and metaphorically in American public life, just out of tantalizing reach of the privileges of the presidency. There was another ex-president who paid homage to Carter, in spirit and word at least. Former President Gerald Ford, whom Carter ejected from the White House in the 1976 election and who died in 2006, had written a eulogy to a rival who became a great friend, which was read by his son Steven. In his final address to the nation, Gerald Ford wrote that even the fierce animosities of politics faded after he and Carter learned that “political defeat and writing can also be liberating if it frees you to discuss topics that aren’t necessarily consistent with short-term political popularity.” Steven Ford turned to Carter’s children after reading the eulogy and told them: “God did a good thing when he made your dad.” But not even death can quell political ill will. And state funerals are a Washington ritual that offers a final chance to settle old scores and to write the history of a presidential administration. Carter’s former domestic policy chief Stuart Eizenstat delivered a gem that applies to each of the former presidents — and Biden especially. “The test of American presidents is not the number of years they serve, but the duration of their accomplishments.” Carter was a one-term president, but his achievements — including the Camp David Middle East peace accord and early embrace of environmentalism — have been lauded since his death as presidency that was often mocked gets a reassessment. Given Trump’s impending inauguration and his legacy of trashing presidential norms, public courtesies and constitutional guardrails, the funeral honoring Carter, who was renowned for supporting global democracy and piety, was always going to take on an allegorical dimension. Jabs at Trump were less overt than those aimed toward him at former Arizona Sen. John McCain’s funeral in 2018. But they were still unmistakable. Ted Mondale, the son of Carter’s late Vice President Walter Mondale, read a remembrance prepared by his father that recalled how he and Carter had together tried to sum up their presidency in their final days in office and came up with: “We told the truth. We obeyed the law. We kept the peace.” It would be hard to apply two-thirds of that epigram to Trump after his first term. As Mondale praised Carter for his early recognition of global warming, a force that is fueling murderous fires in Los Angeles, Trump, a climate change denier, stared at his order of service as he sat beside future first lady Melania Trump. A state funeral is a gathering of the Washington clans, a convocation of the very establishment that Trump has pledged to destroy in his second term. Carter was not a clubbable man and his self-conscious piety was sometimes an irritant for his successors. He was the uneasiest member of the ex-president’s club apart from Trump. But in death, he has become an avatar for the values that many of Trump’s critics see as under threat as his new term dawns. The living president who was closest to Carter was Biden, who endorsed his 1976 presidential run as a young senator and who has delivered veiled rebukes to Trump in his last weeks in power. Given Biden’s antipathy to his predecessor and successor, it was hard not to see deliberate criticism in his eulogy. “We have an obligation to give hate no safe harbor. And to stand up to what my dad used to say is the greatest sin of all, the abuse of power,” Biden said. “We’re all fallible. But it’s about asking ourselves, are we striving to do things, the right things? What value – what are the values that animate our spirit? Do we operate from fear or hope? Ego or generosity? Do we show grace?” State funerals highlight the aging of public figures with whom the country lived when they were more youthful, poignantly marking time in America’s story. The pain of mortality was etched across the face of Amy Carter, now in middle age but whom older Americans remember as a carefree schoolgirl growing up in the White House. And in one of the most moving moments of a ceremony embroidered from the country’s often painful national fable, the Rev. Andrew Young, who was with Martin Luther King Jr. when he was assassinated, sat beside Carter’s casket. He recalled how the ex-president began his century of life growing up in a mostly Black area of rural Georgia and had been a courageous advocate for racial equality in his home state and in the White House. Young, Carter’s former ambassador to the United Nations, read from scripture to end a service that must have been especially poignant for the former presidents, who, in a macabre sense, were getting a preview of their own funerals. The achievements, regrets, thwarted ambitions and acrimonies that still resonate in that presidential pew won’t count for much at the end. Sooner or later, each of them will end up in the nave, just like Carter, in a casket draped in the American flag."
Read this message about political differences delivered from beyond the presidential grave,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/politics/ford-carter-funeral-presidents-what-matters/index.html,"The first two pews at the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter should be a diagram of acrimony. Former President Barack Obama sat next to President-elect Donald Trump. Obama has said Trump is unfit to serve in the White House, and Trump has falsely and repeatedly questioned Obama’s US citizenship. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff sat in front of Trump, although they must still be hurting from her November election loss. Former President George W. Bush sat in front of former Vice President Al Gore, who got more votes than Bush in 2000 but had to accept electoral defeat. Bush did not get the opportunity to talk to Michelle Obama, with whom he has developed a friendship, because the former first lady did not attend the funeral. Gore sat next to former Vice President Mike Pence, whose strained relationship with Trump, a row away, has cost Pence his standing in the GOP. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton could also be aggravated at being seated down the row from Trump, whose 2016 victory over her she never fully accepted. And President Joe Biden, sitting on the aisle in the first pew, still thinks he could have beaten Trump, although he dropped out of the 2024 race under pressure from his fellow Democrats – apparently including Obama. The job of the president, awarded by voters after an election, is by nature adversarial. But this meeting of current and former presidents to mark the passing of one of their own offered an important lesson in how to put politics in its place. It turns out that Carter and former President Gerald Ford, the man he defeated to gain the White House, became close friends after Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan in 1980. They mutually agreed in a phone call to deliver eulogies at their respective funerals even though only one of them, naturally, would be able to fulfill the promise. Ford died in December 2006, and Carter did speak at his predecessor’s funeral in January 2007. Ford’s son, the actor Steven Ford, delivered his father’s prepared remarks at Carter’s funeral, and they contained a touching message about how a cross-partisan friendship developed between the two men who used to be the most powerful person on earth. “By fate of a brief season, Jimmy Carter and I were rivals, but for the many wonderful years that followed, friends bonded us as no two presidents since John Adams and Thomas Jefferson,” Steven Ford said, reading his father’s eulogy. “It was because of our shared values that Jimmy and I respected each other as adversaries even before we cherished one another as dear friends.” It might be hard to believe that people who fight against each other, much less presidents, can develop a friendship. “There is an old line to the effect that two presidents in a room is one too many,” Ford said, noting that he was worried about sharing a flight with Carter to the funeral of assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. “It was somewhere over the Atlantic that Jimmy and I forged a friendship that transcends politics,” Ford said. “We then decided to exercise one of the privileges of a former president, forgetting that one of us had ever said any harsh words about the other one.” They shared “our experiences in discovering that there is indeed life after the White House.” It was at about this moment that Obama could be seen nodding as he shared some words with Trump. They were also seen speaking before the service. Ford said he and Carter agreed the US should more directly take on “the Palestinian issue” in order to work toward lasting peace in the Middle East. That ruffled feathers in Washington, according to Ford’s remarks, written so many years ago. It also feels today like a warning that was not sufficiently heeded by the US government. Ford said both he and Carter learned in their post-presidencies that “political defeat … can also be liberating if it frees you to discuss topics that aren’t necessarily consistent with short-term political popularity.” We should not expect any similar sort of friendship to develop between Obama and Trump or Trump and Biden or the Clintons and Trump, although they did attend his wedding to Melania Trump before Trump entered politics. Carter and Ford, like Clinton, W. Bush and Obama, adhered to the philosophy of retreating from day-to-day politics after leaving the White House. Trump, so far the anomaly, never left the political fight and fought his way back to the White House. And he still has animosity, at least in public, for both Obama and Biden. But Trump is barred by the Constitution from running in a fourth presidential election, which means he will officially join the former presidents club four years from January 20. Perhaps then he and the presidents who came before and after him will find some kind of peace."
Trump seizes on Los Angeles infernos to reopen his feud with Newsom,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/politics/trump-newsom-los-angeles-fires-analysis/index.html,"Walls of fire devoured neighborhoods, forcing tens of thousands of residents to flee for their lives. But as a cataclysm fueled by windstorms charred swathes of Los Angeles, Donald Trump spotted an opportunity. The president-elect responded to six massive blazes by reopening his long-term feud with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, landing an early jab on a Democratic governor and a state likely to emerge as a major opponent to his second term plans. Trump and Newsom have clashed bitterly in the past, including over fire prevention, environmental policies, climate change, green vehicles and immigration. And the incoming president wasted no time in laying the blame for simultaneous wildfires raging in the Los Angeles area that have so far killed at least five people. Trump slammed “the gross incompetence and mismanagement of the Biden/Newscum Duo,” in a post on his Truth Social network. He claimed that California environmental policies that divert fresh water to preserve wetlands and wildlife were to blame for hydrants running dry. “I will demand that this incompetent governor allow beautiful, clean, fresh water to FLOW INTO CALIFORNIA! He is the blame for this,” Trump wrote as part of a flurry of social media posts, later writing that Newsom should resign. In Trump’s misinformation game, it doesn’t really matter whether it’s true that Newsom is responsible for diverting water to protect the delta smelt – “a worthless fish” in Trump’s words – and that, as a result, homes of Angelenos were burned down. The president-elect just needs enough people to believe it might be the case to inflict political damage on the governor, who’s one of the nation’s most high-profile Democrats and a possible 2028 presidential hopeful. California is also a perfect target as a liberal state that went for Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s election. The conceit of a state and city inflicting self-defeating environmental policies is a perfect fit for Trump’s narrative that liberal governance in blue states and cities invites chaos, crime and misery. “This is not Government. I can’t wait till January 20th!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. There will be legitimate questions about California’s and Los Angeles’ level of preparedness for the fires. Newsom and city officials will be called to account for any failures – like many politicians tested in the crucible of natural disasters. But in such dire situations, blame usually awaits the ebbing of the crisis. Newsom told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that “one can’t even respond” to Trump’s attacks. “People are literally fleeing, people have lost their lives, kids lost their schools, families completely torn asunder, churches burned down – this guy wanted to politicize it.” “I have a lot of thoughts about what I want to say, and I won’t,” the governor added. In this specific case, Trump’s complaints about the freshwater issue being to blame for difficulties in responding appeared to be at best a vast simplification of complex factors at play. But after a meeting with Republican senators on Thursday, the president-elect doubled down. “This is a true tragedy, and it’s a mistake of the governor,” Trump told reporters. “They don’t have any water. Millions and millions of gallons of water that they have, and they send it out into the Pacific.” But water officials said that while hydrants in Pacific Palisades did run dry early Wednesday, there was sufficient water in Southern California to fight the fires. The logistics of getting enough of it to Pacific Palisades – and at the rate overwhelmed firefighters need to control the blazes – were prohibitive. Still, Trump’s attacks were a characteristic attempt to politicize a natural disaster while it is still unfolding. Newsom spokesman Anthony York told CNN that “we’re focused on protecting lives and battling these blazes – not playing politics.” Normal practice for a national leader when disaster strikes is to bury partisan grievances, unite behind Americans in need and pledge to stand with the victims for as long as it takes. Even Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has often locked horns with Newsom and California in the past – especially over pandemic lockdowns – offered prayers and assistance to California. “When disaster strikes, we must come together to help our fellow Americans in any way we can,” DeSantis wrote on X. Newsom praised his fellow Democrat, President Joe Biden, for quickly bringing the might of the federal government to bear as the infernos gathered strength with a major disaster declaration. “It’s impossible for me to express the level of appreciation and cooperation we received from the White House in this administration,” Newsom said, standing alongside the president in Santa Monica on Wednesday. “So on behalf of all of us, Mr. President, thank you for being here.” Biden said the federal government was prepared to do “anything and everything” to contain the fires and listed multiple military deployments to fight the disaster. He, however, ended the media availability on a jarring tonal note by marking the arrival of a new family member, after his granddaughter Naomi gave birth at an area hospital. “The good news is, I am a great-grandfather as of today,” he said. The White House announced late Wednesday that Biden will no longer travel to Rome, Italy, this week as scheduled, canceling the trip in the final days of his presidency to monitor the wildfires. Trump’s attacks on Biden and Newsom are his latest attempt to portray the outgoing administration as incompetent, apparently designed to flatter his own incoming White House team by comparison. His comments suggest that his second administration, which begins in 11 days, will be just as unorthodox and turbulent as his first, and will be punctuated by angry outbursts on social media against his opponents even during crises. Trump and Newsom have a deeply antagonistic relationship, which is exacerbated by their sharply differing ideologies and the fact that mighty California has the power to frustrate some of the president-elect’s political priorities. Trump is also fixated on the management of forests and fire prevention, including his view that Democratic jurisdictions conduct insufficient clearance of fallen foliage, which he insists is to blame for many fires. “The Governor of California, @GavinNewsom, has done a terrible job of forest management,” Trump wrote on what was then Twitter in November 2019. “I told him from the first day we met that he must ‘clean’ his forest floors regardless of what his bosses, the environmentalists, DEMAND of him. Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers…..” Trump’s tweet, during a previous California wildfire crisis, seemed incongruous at the time since it followed praise from Newsom for his efforts to help his state. Environmentalists argue that the real problem that makes California so susceptible to worsening fire seasons is something that Trump refuses to accept exists – climate change. In the current crisis, parched earth and unseasonal heat made Los Angeles a tinderbox that was deeply vulnerable to the added catalyst of roaring high winds that spread fires. During another California wildfires crisis, as millions of acres burned in 2020, Trump dismissed an appeal from Wade Crowfoot, the state’s natural resources secretary, to acknowledge the impact of global warming. “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch,” Trump said. When Crowfoot asked him to look at the science, he added: “I don’t think science knows, actually.” Trump insisted on Capitol Hill Wednesday that he “got along well” with Newsom despite their differences. But their renewed estrangement could be a problem for California as it will potentially soon be seeking hundreds of millions in dollars in federal disaster aid from the Republican-controlled White House and Congress. “It looks like we are going to be the ones having to rebuild it,” Trump said after meeting the senators. And Trump and Newsom will be at odds over more than fires. The governor has already pledged to act if Trump seeks to wipe out electric vehicle tax credits. And his state is likely to be at the vanguard of legal efforts to thwart Trump administration policies in many areas, including immigration and reproductive rights. There are many previous examples of Trump politicizing national crises. In 2017, he was criticized for his handling of Hurricane Maria that devastated Puerto Rico and killed nearly 3,000 people. There is blame to go around when relief efforts fall short, and the then-president was not solely responsible for the missteps in the federal and local responses. But he repeatedly blamed local leaders and complained about the level of aid that was required, falsely claiming that the operation was an “an incredible, unsung success.” And Trump’s management of the Covid-19 pandemic contained multiple examples of him trying to preserve his political fortunes that ironically helped seal his defeat in the 2020 election. More recently, Trump seized on the terror attack that killed 14 people in New Orleans on January 1, falsely implying on social media that the suspect was an undocumented migrant who recently crossed the southern border. It was a reminder that in times of national stress, the president-elect’s first response has sometimes been to seek political gain instead of promoting unity and facts-based responses."
It’s the first major decision of Trump 2.0 and Republicans are split,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/politics/republican-priorities-reconciliation-what-matters/index.html,"How do you cram multiple big promises through a very tiny majority? That’s the tricky question facing Republicans in Washington, who claim they’ve been given a mandate to enact sweeping permanent change after November’s election, but have one of the smallest congressional majorities in history to work with. CNN’s Capitol Hill team has reported that Republicans are currently looking at two paths: Republicans aren’t putting on the pretense of pushing for bipartisanship. In either the one-bill or two-bill scenarios, they’ll utilize the complicated budgeting process known as “reconciliation” to get around Democratic obstruction in the Senate and deliver something big with only a simple majority. Here’s how CNN’s Manu Raju and Sarah Ferris outline the complicated reconciliation process: Unlike most legislation, which can be blocked by a minority in the Senate, reconciliation is exempt from the filibuster because it is supposed to allow lawmakers to reconcile the budget. Ironically, it is often used to do the opposite. Here’s how Raju and Ferris explain the leverage strategy behind one massive bill: Trump and his allies know that they can count on two years of unified control before the next election and that reconciliation is the most direct route to deliver a key piece of legislation. American legislators have fallen into a pattern in recent years. A new president is elected with control of the House and the Senate and they use reconciliation to enact a signature piece of legislation in their first two years in office. They then lose control of the House of Representatives in the next midterm elections. Variations on this pattern have occurred in each of the last three presidencies. Yes. During his first term, Trump and Republicans initially tried to use reconciliation to repeal ACA, also known as Obamacare, but failed when three Republican senators opposed the effort. Arizona Sen. John McCain dramatically killed the effort with a late-night no-vote on the Senate floor as he was being treated for brain cancer. McCain has since died. That failure to repeal Obamacare continues to sting Trump and Republicans, and they will have it in mind as they consider how to proceed with their agenda when he retakes the White House. For what it’s worth, Trump still says he’d like to replace Obamacare, but he only has “concepts” of a plan, which he hasn’t shared publicly. In fact, Republicans have not publicly shared their specific plans for any of their current top priorities related to immigration, energy production or taxes. There will be serious debates on what they can pass related to any issue – such as on immigration, especially if a legislative debate happens alongside Trump’s promised mass deportation effort. Trump made a lot of new tax promises on the campaign trail in 2024, including ending taxes on tips and social security, among many other things. Taken together, they would greatly reduce the revenue the US government uses for services and the social safety net. CNN’s Tami Luhby has reported that extending the current tax cuts and adding on all of Trump’s additional promises would “blow a nearly $8 trillion hole into the federal budget over the next decade.” It’s also worth noting that there was not unanimous Republican support for his tax plan in 2017. Twelve Republican representatives and one Republican senator opposed the tax cuts bill in Trump’s first term. Most of those votes were from lawmakers representing districts in New York and New Jersey who were angry that the law drastically reduced the amount of state and local taxes their constituents could deduct from federal tax bills. A few of those  lawmakers remain in Congress, including New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who, despite her opposition to Trump’s signature legislative achievement, is now among his most loyal supporters on Capitol Hill. Trump actually tapped Stefanik to be his US ambassador to the United Nations, an important point since she would need to leave elective office once confirmed, further trimming Republicans’ House majority. It’s tight. Along with Trump’s pick of Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to be his national security adviser and the exit of former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who is no longer Trump’s pick to be attorney general, the House majority would shrink to 217 Republicans compared to 215 Democrats early in Trump’s term. Johnson may have to wait for those seats to be filled in order to pass anything remotely controversial. Gaetz’s replacement, for instance, won’t be elected until April 1. The timeline for replacing Waltz and Stefanik will not be known until they resign. It depends. In Trump’s first term, Republicans ultimately failed in their effort to repeal Obamacare with reconciliation in July 2017. The subsequent tax cuts legislation was signed by Trump into law in December of that year. During Biden’s term, the Covid-focused American Rescue Plan was signed into law in March 2021, while the Inflation Reduction Act came more than a year later, in 2022, just before a midterm in which Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives."
"Trump’s threats to Greenland, Canada and Panama explain everything about America First",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/politics/trump-greenland-canada-panama-analysis/index.html,"Donald Trump’s imperialist designs on Greenland, Canada and Panama often sound like the ramblings of a real estate shark who equates foreign and trade policy to a hunt for new deals. But there’s method in his expansionist mindset. Trump, in his unique way, is grappling with national security questions the US must face in a new world shaped by China’s rise, the inequalities of globalization, melting polar ice and great power instability. His attitude also embodies the “America First” principle of using US strength to relentlessly pursue narrow national interests, even by coercing smaller, allied powers. Trump’s musings about terminating the Panama Canal Treaty especially show the preoccupation of the new administration with the encroachment of foreign powers into the Western Hemisphere. This isn’t a new concern — it’s been a constant thread in American history, dating back to the Monroe Doctrine in the 1820s when European colonialists were the threat. The issue endured through the communist scares of the Cold War. Today’s usurpers are China, Russia and Iran. Trump’s belief, meanwhile, that the United States should rule supreme in its own sphere of influence is also an important hint about how he might manage key global hotspots, including the war in Ukraine and potentially even Taiwan. But his 21st century neocolonialism is a huge risk and appears certain to run headlong into international law. And Trump could compromise America’s power by trashing alliances built up over generations and alienating its friends. Trump poured fuel on a tense world waiting with trepidation for his second term on Tuesday when a reporter asked him if he could rule out force to seize back the Panama Canal or to take over strategically important Greenland. “I’m not going to commit to that, no,” Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. “It might be that you’ll have to do something.” Canadians were relieved to learn that the president-elect won’t be sending the 82nd Airborne across the 49th parallel. He said he’d only use economic force to annex the proud sovereign democracy to the north and make it the 51st state. As often with Trump, his threats came with a mixture of malice and mischief. And there was a characteristic element of farce as the president-elect’s son, Donald Jr., flew the family’s Boeing to Greenland, with a bobblehead of his father perched on the cockpit control panel. “Make Greenland Great Again!” the president-elect posted on his Truth Social network shortly before his son landed. It’s unlikely Trump will get what he wants with Canada, Panama or Greenland. So his strategy might be aimed at getting better deals for the US — perhaps a discount for American vessels transiting the key waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, greater American access to rare earth minerals in Greenland and sea routes revealed by melting polar ice, as well as a new trade deal with Canada that might advantage US manufacturers. Trump would be sure to portray any of these as a massive win only he could have achieved, even if they end up being rather cosmetic like his first-term US-Mexico-Canada pact. But Trump’s threats flesh out one of his foreign policy rationales: that each country should aggressively pursue their goals unilaterally in a manner that will inevitably profit strong, rich nations like the United States. “As president, I have rejected the failed approaches of the past, and I am proudly putting America first, just as you should be putting your countries first. That’s okay — that’s what you should be doing,” Trump told the United Nations General Assembly in 2020. This is a doctrine distilled from a life in which Trump has tried to always be the most aggressive person in every room in pursuit of “wins” over weaker opponents. This explains his remark that Denmark should hand over Greenland, a self-governing entity inside its kingdom, because it’s important to US security. If not, Trump said, “I would tariff Denmark at a very high level.” The president-elect also characterized the US decision to hand over the Panama Canal in 1999 under a treaty signed by Jimmy Carter as folly that squandered the advantages of US power. He claimed falsely that American ships were discriminated against in transit fees and that China, not Panama, was operating the waterway. (Beijing-owned firms do run some ports in Panama). “We gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn’t give it to China, and they’ve abused it,” Trump said just before Carter’s body arrived in Washington before Thursday’s state funeral. Trump’s tough-guy approach also explains why he sees little distinction between US allies and adversaries. He, for example, complained Tuesday that Canada, America’s closest geographical friend, was freeloading off the US defense umbrella and therefore should be a state rather than a nation. Such a view repudiates the US-led liberal order that sees alliances as investments that multiply American power and protect democracy and freedom. Sending troops to grab the Panama Canal or Greenland might contradict Trump’s campaign trail warnings that the US should avoid new foreign entanglements. But it exemplifies the “America First” ideology. A retreat from the old world in a Trump second term could be be replaced by “continentalism” that might “displace globalism,” argued Hal Brands, a professor of global affairs at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, in Foreign Affairs last May. This would update the doctrine unveiled by President James Monroe in 1823, to which President Theodore Roosevelt later added a corollary — that the United States should protect life and property in Latin American countries. While Trump has set off global consternation with his new Panama Canal rhetoric, he first broached a tougher line in America’s backyard in his first term. “Here in the Western Hemisphere, we are committed to maintaining our independence from the encroachment of expansionist foreign powers,” Trump told the UN General Assembly in 2018. “It has been the formal policy of our country since President Monroe that we reject the interference of foreign nations in this hemisphere and in our own affairs.” His policy represented a split with the Obama administration that is consistent with Trump’s backlash politics. In 2013, then-Secretary of State John Kerry told the Organization of American States, “The era of the Monroe Doctrine is over.” The 21st century Monroe reboot targets China, Russia, Iran and their business, military and intelligence partnerships in nations like Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Cuba. Marco Rubio — a surprising pick for Trump’s secretary of state given his traditionalist foreign policy leanings — is on the same page as his new boss on hemispheric affairs. The Florida senator said at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing in 2022 that China was wielding economic influence in a way that hurt regional economies and boosted cartels that export fentanyl and violence across US borders. “They do this because they know that chaos in Latin America and the Caribbean would severely hurt us, destabilize us, who they view as their primary and central rival,” Rubio said. “We simply can’t afford to let the Chinese Communist Party expand its influence and absorb Latin America and the Caribbean into its private political-economic bloc.” Trump’s expansionist vision reflects supreme confidence heading into his second term, which he’s determined to use to leave an era-defining mark on America’s global role. And his personification of the principle of the strong triumphing over the weak might also inform his approach to other global issues — most notably the war in Ukraine. In a striking moment Tuesday, Trump said he understood Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fear that the nation he invaded could join NATO. “Russia has somebody right on their doorstep, and I could understand their feeling about that,” the president-elect said. The possibility that Trump could accept Russia’s terms was already a concern. His former national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, recorded one moment when Putin drew an analogy between his illegal claims to Ukraine and historic US concerns about its hemisphere. “Putin used his time with Trump to launch a sophisticated and sustained campaign to manipulate him,” McMaster wrote in his book “At War with Ourselves.” He added: “to suggest moral equivalence between U.S. interventions in Latin America and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin cited the ‘Roosevelt Corollary’ to the Monroe Doctrine.” Trump’s bombast may delight his supporters. But many foreigners think it’s arrogant. An attempt to seize the Panama Canal would be regarded as geopolitical piracy. Invading Greenland would make a mockery of international law. And Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — whose already doomed career suffered a final blow because of Trump’s tariff threats — lampooned Trump’s designs on the Great White North on Tuesday. “There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,” he wrote on X. This reaction shows the downside of Trump’s approach. His bullying of America’s friends may alienate whole populations. Some foreign policy experts fear American threats and pressure in Latin America may actually push nations closer to China. And insults about Canada being better off as the 51st state are likely to harden public opinion there against the incoming US president and make it harder for the next prime minister to clinch deals with him. Trump’s disregard for the other peoples’ patriotism could also poison America’s longest lasting friendships. Not to mention frighten entire populations. “The majority in Greenland find it quite scary and quite uncomfortable … that the US, in a disrespectful way, is showing that they would like to be buying Greenland or controlling Greenland,” Aaja Chemnitz, a member of the Danish parliament and a Greenland resident, told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “Greenland is not MAGA. Greenland is not going to be MAGA.”"
Trump wants to redraw the map of the Western Hemisphere,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/politics/trump-expansion-ideas-what-matters/index.html,"In addition to his bumper sticker promises to put America first and make it great again, soon-to-be President Donald Trump also apparently wants to redraw the map of the Western Hemisphere to make America much bigger. And he’s not ruling out the use of military force. During a weaving, hour-plus dissertation for reporters at Mar-a-lago on Tuesday, Trump teased the “dawn of American’s golden age,” which includes: Obtaining Greenland from Denmark: “They should give it up because we need it for national security. That’s for the free world. I’m talking about protecting the free world.” Reclaiming the Panama Canal from Panama: “We gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn’t give it to China, and they’ve abused it.” Turning Canada into the 51st state and pushing hockey great Wayne Gretzky as a candidate for governor: “Canada is subsidized to the tune of about $200 billion a year, plus other things. And they don’t, essentially, have a military. They have a very small military. We – they rely on our military.” Renaming the Gulf of Mexico: “We’re going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, which has a beautiful ring. That covers a lot of territory. The Gulf of America, what a beautiful name.” It’s not clear how serious he is about pursuing any of these specific ideas, but the fact that he keeps independently mentioning Greenland, Panama and Canada suggests they aren’t necessarily fleeting notions. CNN’s Steve Contorno looked at Trump’s similar comments late last year. Plus, Trump’s interest in Greenland was evident during his first administration, when he reportedly considered trying to trade Greenland for Puerto Rico. Conversely, Trump has long talked about the opposite of expansion – securing the border with Mexico – when he takes office. Expansion is built into the American DNA, said the retired Amb. Gordon Gray, now a professor of practice at George Washington University and former career Foreign Service officer. “From landing in Jamestown and Plymouth Rock, there’s the concept of Manifest Destiny and the perceived need to continue to move west, to Jefferson’s Louisiana Purchase,” he said. While the period of expansion slowed early in the 20th century, Alaska and Hawaii became states in 1959. There are those who would argue, Gray added, that US-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were a form of American expansion. Early in US history, President James Monroe established the Monroe Doctrine, which was tucked into his 1823 message to Congress and essentially warned European powers against further colonization in the Western Hemisphere. As he was overseeing construction of the Panama Canal, President Theodore Roosevelt expanded on the Monroe Doctrine with the Roosevelt Corollary, to argue that the US had a responsibility to help countries in the Western Hemisphere. Trump’s usually isolationist rhetoric would seem to contradict the idea of the US as protector of the West. And his complaints about Canada, Panama and Mexico all revolve around the idea that the US is being cheated. That Trump refused, when asked by a reporter, to rule out using the American military to obtain land in either Greenland or Panama could give whiplash to Americans who recall his promise during the presidential campaign to keep the US out of wars. But the lack of any specifics about obtaining or annexing Greenland or Panama suggests these proposals are still very much in the idea stage. Still, Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., fed the chatter about Greenland Tuesday with a trip to the world’s largest island. He posted a video from the cockpit of a plane – adorned with a gun-toting Trump bobblehead – that was apparently preparing to land in Greenland, as well as video of Greenlanders in MAGA hats. It obtained the US Virgin Islands from the Kingdom of Denmark in 1917 for $25 million in gold coin, but only after decades of attempts to acquire them. Today, the US Virgin Islands are one of five US territories, including the largest and most populous of Puerto Rico. Those born in US territories are US citizens, but they only get token representation in Congress and can only vote in presidential elections if they move to a US state. CNN’s Laura Paddison writes that there are plenty of reasons for the US to be interested in Greenland, including its wealth of minerals at a time when China dominates global rare earth production. Trump talked during his first term about acquiring it even though Denmark showed no interest in selling, much like now. Gray said there are clear strategic reasons for the US to be interested in acquiring Greenland, which is why Trump’s comments about it deserve special attention. “I would distinguish between desire to purchase Greenland on the one hand, and then his comments about Canada being the 51st state, and Wayne Gretzky should be the next governor of Canada, and things like that, which are very clearly designed just to put a thumb in in Justin Trudeau’s eye,” said Gray, referring to the Canadian prime minister who announced this week that he will step down. Trump’s comments about the Panama Canal also seem more political to Gray, since they are geared at complaining about China’s growing influence, a key issue to many of Trump’s followers. Legacy is an issue that is important to Trump, which was clear from the way he wove Jimmy Carter into his comments about the Panama Canal. In his comments to reporters, Trump noted that Carter signed a treaty returning the Canal zone to Panama after 75 years of US rule. Carter, coincidentally, died last month and was transported Tuesday to Washington, DC, where he will lie in state at the US Capitol. Trump, ruminating on Carter’s legacy, told reporters the decision to cede control of the canal cost Carter the White House. “Giving the Panama Canal is why Jimmy Carter lost the election, in my opinion,” Trump said."

MAGA’s new darling: Dem. John Fetterman?,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/politics/video/magas-new-darling-dem-john-fetterman,
How these older voters who backed Harris are engaging in ‘quiet resistance’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/26/politics/pennsylvania-older-voters-trump-resistance/index.html,"Pat Levin, 95 years young, is wrestling daily with something new and depressing. “It’s left me very afraid,” she said of the 2024 election. “Afraid of the future. Afraid of everything.” That Donald Trump will be president in her twilight is by far the biggest slice of Levin’s post-election funk. But there’s more: Democratic Sen. Bob Casey was defeated, as was her Democratic congresswoman, Rep. Susan Wild. Her first memories of politics are of Franklin Roosevelt, and Levin has lived through Vietnam, Watergate, the September 11 attacks and more. And yet this feels more significant, more threatening. “I want to fight,” Levin said in an interview last week. “I don’t want to fight. I think I have to. Because I think there’s no such thing as staying neutral. I think once you stay neutral, it’s the oppressor who wins and the oppressed who suffer.” Levin is a lifelong Democrat who wasn’t happy when Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush or George W. Bush won the presidency. But never did if feel like this. Her Republican neighbors tell her to relax, that it will all be fine. Levin trusts her instincts. “I see a man who is not — or a regime now — who is not paying much attention to our history and our norms,” Levin said. “Say what you’d like, but I’m scared. … I’m afraid. Not so afraid for me — I’m not going to be around probably to experience it. But I’m afraid for those I love, for those I don’t love, those I know, those I don’t know. It’s all those people coming after me who might have to live under this.” We met, for a third time over the past year, at the Bethlehem studio where Levin regularly does Pilates. She is sharp and witty and energetic. But she worries she may have been on the losing side in her last presidential election. “I’m pretty sure,” Levin said matter of factly about Trump being the last president she sees. “I mean at my age. Chances are good that he will be.” Levin is among the voters who participated in our All Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of Americans who live in key battlegrounds or are part of critical voting groups, or both. Voters over the age of 65 are among the most reliable to cast ballots. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris evenly split these voters nationally, with 49% each, according to exit polls. In Pennsylvania, Trump had an edge with voters 65 and over – 52% to 48% for Harris. Levin lives in Northampton County, a place with a history of picking presidents. The winner in Northampton has carried Pennsylvania and won the White House in five consecutive elections, and all but three dating back 100 years. Levin sees women’s rights in retreat; lies and distortions that go largely unchallenged; meanness toward immigrants; and disdain for civility and democratic norms. “It’s a scary thing when you think about — is Elon Musk the shadow president?” Levin said. “Isn’t that scary to have to ask that question? Have we ever had to ask that before?” We visited Levin and others in our Northampton County voter group just days after a post-election trip to Iowa, where Republicans who supported Trump were ebullient at his sweep of the swings states and win in the popular vote. Those Republicans support mass deportations and trade tariffs and see him as a strong leader on the world stage, while dismissing talk he is a threat to democracy. Conversations with Democrats so soon after felt like entering a parallel universe. “There are no guardrails any longer,” Levin said. “I mean, he has control. Control of the Supreme Court. What’s left in terms of stopping him? I don’t know what that is unless it’s a people. And it takes people with a lot of courage to buck that trend.” Marvin Boyer, too, is beyond disappointed in the election outcome and sees many troubling things on Trump’s priorities list. But he prefers to wait and see if things will be as bad as Levin predicts. “I always think positive and hope that our better angels will, you know, resurrect,” said Boyer, a lifelong resident of Easton, Pennsylvania. “But, again, it was a message of divisiveness, of separation, of fear, and that seemed to resonate with a good deal of the population unfortunately.” Boyer, 75, has been a civil rights and community activist as long as he can remember. We met at a community center where the main meeting space is dedicated to Boyer’s mother. On this day, it was being used to pack and organize Thanksgiving meal bags, and the community garden behind the building was another example of how local heroes like Boyer do what they can to help those who need a hand. He urges disappointed Democrats to, like him, find a cause or causes close to home. “This will not be my first disappointment rodeo,” Boyer said. “You have to give him a chance, despite some misgivings I have. … I often run into people who complain a lot, you know, and I’m a doer, and I say, be the change that you want to see in the community. Get involved in a local organization. Be more of an activist.” Still, it is clear Boyer’s innate optimism faces challenges processing what he hears from Trump and what he sees from some voters, including fellow Black men in his own beloved community. “It looks like it’s a revenge thing that he’s going for,” is how Boyer characterized the president-elect’s Cabinet and other personnel choices. “A big frankly, F-You to the other side.” Boyer sees Trump as constantly stoking fears about America becoming more diverse, which makes the president-elect’s inroads among Black men especially troubling to him. “I will hear what they have to say, and that’s what I do. I listen,” Boyer said. Then his turn: “Why do you feel that way? Why would you vote for this guy? Why would you vote for an individual who I think is a racist who is a misogynist. … Who is with the January 6 situation? Why would you vote for a guy like that?” The response usually follows these lines, Boyer said: “Because he tells it like it is, and that resonates with me.” Boyer’s suggestion to channel disappointment into activism is already part of Darrell Ann Murphy’s post-election plan — one she adopted with friends after a few days of crying. “Friends of mine have started groups, we’re calling it the quiet resistance,” Murphy said in an interview at her home in suburban Palmer Township, a short drive from Easton. “We still have a voice. This is, you know, November of 2024, we still have a voice, not sure about 2025, but this is still America.” Murphy, 84, teaches the Chinese tile game Mahjong, and says she was blindsided by the election results – in Northampton County and nationally – because most of the fellow seniors taking classes were Harris supporters. Three weeks later, she’s still trying to understand and is most worried about reproductive rights and a Trump tone Murphy sees as toxic. “I don’t know how long I’m going to be around,” Murphy said. “I need to feel for my kids and grandchildren and the next generation, I need to feel some hope, some hope. Means more, means more to seniors. You know it really does.” Our recent visit was the third time we sat in on a Mahjong game at Murphy’s home – the third time she and Catherine Long sparred feistily with Pamela Aita, a Republican and Trump supporter. “I don’t have to have dinner with Donald Trump,” Aita, 72, said when character questions came up. “I don’t care what he does. Just keep me safe, keep my grandkids safe, and have money in our pockets. That’s all. That’s what, that’s my concern. I think the man can do that job. “ Long, 68, took issue. “I have a problem having a man keep me safe who is a convicted felon and doesn’t believe in the laws of the land,” she said. “I’m scared to death of what he’s going to do.” Aita reminds her friends Trump was president before. “Did anything horrible happen to the country?” she asked. Long and Murphy said Trump was incompetent handling the Covid-19 pandemic. That they can spar, and smile, is sadly rare in today’s polarized politics. Aita at first blames Trump’s critics, but then agrees he, too, often stokes the fighting. “I’m saying both parties, both parties,” she said. “Knock it off. … Just let’s all come together for this country. It’s just, I don’t know, I don’t like the division and everything.” Murphy can agree on that point. “It’s awful,” she said. “It is affecting every family, every friendship.” But the disagreement stirs again as Aita tries to wrap that point. “We have to just knock it off,” she said. “He’s president for four years. We’ll have another election.” Long interjects. “We hope,” she said. “I have fears that he won’t leave.” Aita: “Come on. That’s ridiculous.” Long: “I’m not kidding. I have fears that he won’t leave.” The CNN visitor suggests it can be a topic of polite Mahjong debate for the next four years. “If we’re still here on this earth,” Murphy said. “Yes,” Aita echoed. “We might not be here, John. You ever think of that?” Back to the game. Won on this day, perhaps fittingly, by Aita, the Trump supporter."
Even Iowa Republicans who initially wanted to move on from Trump see hope — and a mandate — in his win,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/iowa-voters-trump-mandate/index.html,"Shanen Ebersole believes if people better understood her life they would better understand her unapologetic vote for Donald Trump. “The majority of people who voted for Trump are not the far-right crazies,” Ebersole said in an interview. “That is not who we are. We are simple Americans who want to live our lives and do our jobs and make our own choices in our own homes.” Ebersole and her husband have a cattle ranch in southwest Iowa, in a little town of rolling hills and gravel roads. “DoorDash isn’t a thing,” Ebersole said with a smile. “Pizza delivery is not a thing. You can’t even get pizza delivered where we live.” Kellerton is in Ringgold County, along the Iowa-Missouri border. Trump won 75% of the county vote. Ebersole said the reasons why are straightforward. “Care about all of us, don’t prioritize small individual groups first,” she said. “We felt as though Washington and the far edges of our country were governing the rest of middle America.” Ebersole wasn’t as bullish about Trump at the outset of the presidential campaign. Yes, she voted for him in 2016 and 2020, but she supported former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the Iowa caucuses because while she approves of most Trump policies, she believed it important that Republicans find a new leader who could be both president and role model. “He wasn’t as respectful as I think our president should be,” Ebersole told us when we first met in December 2023. “Because he didn’t bring us together. Because of the divisiveness. Because of my liberal friends who were literally scared for their safety.” Once Trump clinched the nomination, Ebersole said her choice was easy because of Biden-Harris administration farm and climate policies she says punish small operators like her family business. “Those policies made it a no-brainer for me,” Ebersole said. “My only reticence was wanting to bring us together.” Now, with Trump preparing to return to the White House, Ebersole again stressed her hope for a less confrontational politics. But her tone about Trump and the sources of division is different. “They are still scared,” she said of her liberal friends. “The fear tactics of the left make them more afraid of Trump. … The point that I would really tell my liberal friends to understand is just because we voted in a very conservative president, that means that we don’t want to put rules on you either. We just care about our own liberties.” Ebersole is among the voters who participated in our All Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters in key voting blocs or from key campaign battlegrounds. Iowa was our first stop, back when the first question of the 2024 campaign was whether Trump retained his grip on the GOP. We visited three times during the campaign, and then returned after the election to get a sense of what these Republican voters want and expect when Trump returns to the White House in January. Ebersole said she hopes the president-elect reads his mandate as an urgent call to focus on the economy and immigration. “Deportation is necessary because we have allowed way too many undocumented people to come in,” Ebersole said. “But we also need a path, a path for those people to become Americans.” She is an unabashed fan of Trump’s call for tariffs on foreign products. “Why are we bringing Argentinian beef in?” she asked. “Why are we bringing in New Zealand and Australian beef in and then exporting some of our beef? Why don’t we first just feed our beef to our Americans?” And she hopes Trump looks at his victory in the popular vote and understands that voters like her want him to set aside the campaign talk about rooting out “the enemy within” or seeking retribution. “We are not letting him be a bully, but we want him to stand firm,” she said. Like Ebersole, Betsy Sarcone began the election cycle believing it was time for Republicans to move on from Trump. She was so adamant that she initially said she would vote for President Joe Biden if it came down to a rematch of the 2020 race. “I just can’t put my rubber stamp on Trump having more influence over this country,” Sarcone told us in August 2023. “Because I view Trump as not having any personal accountability.” But Sarcone viewed Vice President Kamala Harris as too liberal and inauthentic and ended up “actually excited” to cast her vote for Trump. “I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t love Donald Trump as a person, but I do think he is right for the country right now and that he is going to chart a different course.” “I’m feeling relieved,” she said in an interview at her home in suburban Des Moines last week. “Honestly, it’s nice to not have to feel like you are silent anymore.” That last part is instructive; Trump’s win in the popular vote alongside his battleground state sweeps is emboldening to his supporters When we first met Sarcone, Trump’s toxic language and temper were reasons she cited in searching for a different Republican candidate. Now, though, when asked about Trump’s angry words at campaign rallies, she offered a different take. “What I see is him being mad at an open border, being mad at the crime rates, being mad at the economy,” Sarcone said. “I’m completely OK with that.” Her priorities: lower interest rates to help her real estate business, and lower grocery prices. “I’m a mom, single mother of three kids,” she said. “So that does make a huge difference in my life.” She does not have amnesia about Trump’s first term. “When Trump gets off track, off his train of thought, that’s when we get in trouble. If we are focused on the goals, focused on what we really need to fix this country, I think we are going to be OK,” Sarcone said. Her patience is already being tested, though Sarcone said she has a different perspective on how to cope. Some early Trump Cabinet picks, especially former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, have triggered eye rolls or worse. “Not necessarily excited,” Sarcone said. “Worried? I wouldn’t say I am worried. … I’m just going to put my trust in him at this point.” She stays calm by remembering she could not vote for Harris. “I voted for change, as did the majority of people, and that is what we are going to get,” Sarcone said. “So I don’t think worrying about it every day is going to do me any good.” Chris Mudd is a Team Trump original — going back to 2015. He owns Midwest Solar and his vote could hurt his business; the startup has benefited from Biden administration clean energy incentives. “It’s possible,” Mudd said of taking a hit if Trump ends those incentives. “I sell value. I sell saving money, not selling the green energy side of the business.” But he urged Trump to go full speed ahead, including with tariffs that could raise prices on Chinese components he needs for some big solar installations. “Most of our stuff is tariff free,” Mudd said in an interview at his Waterloo office last week. “So, I want to see more products and services get built in this country. I want to see our pharmaceuticals get produced here instead of China.” Mudd believes Congress should confirm Trump’s personnel picks and quickly act on his policy priorities as well. “It’s important that we round up every illegal and ship them out,” Mudd said. “And we have to figure out a way to get them back to work. I do believe that we need immigration. A country needs immigration. It just needs to be legal.” Mudd said the mood among Trump supporters is “excitement and optimism. … The stock market is jumping up. I think business is going to get good.” And he took issue with Trump critics who see his agenda as mean spirited. “I would say, ‘Get over it,’” Mudd said. “I don’t believe there is anything to be scared of. There are people who are scared. But I believe it is false. I believe they are scared over things that are not real.”"
Fact check: Debunking Trump’s false claims about Canada,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/politics/fact-check-trumps-false-claims-canada/index.html,"President-elect Donald Trump keeps making false claims about Canada. Trump has spoken repeatedly in the past month about somehow turning the independent country to the north into the 51st US state. It is not clear whether Trump’s self-proclaimed “great idea” is mere trolling, a serious desire or an unorthodox negotiating tactic in bilateral discussions over trade, immigration and national security. What is clear is that Trump has peppered his comments about Canada with inaccurate assertions – about how the Canadian public views the idea of US annexation, about the trade relationship and about Canada’s defense situation. Here is a fact check of some of his remarks. Trump said Thursday of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: “I called him Governor Trudeau because they should be the 51st state, really. It would make a great state. And the people of Canada like it.” Facts First: Trump’s categorical claim that “the people of Canada like it” is false. Though it’s certainly possible to find Canadians who support the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state, the idea is overwhelmingly unpopular with the Canadian public as a whole. A December poll by the firm Leger found that 82% of Canadians said they didn’t like the idea and just 13% said they liked it. The idea has been denounced by federal and provincial Canadian leaders from left to right. Trump said Tuesday that the US has a “$200 billion” trade deficit with Canada. Facts First: False. The US goods and services trade deficit with Canada was about $40.6 billion in 2023, according to the US government’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, nowhere close to “$200 billion.” Even if you only consider trade in goods and ignore the services trade at which the US excels, the US deficit with Canada was about $72.3 billion in 2023, the bureau reported, still far shy of Trump’s figure. And it’s worth noting that the deficit is overwhelmingly caused by the US importing a large quantity of inexpensive Canadian oil, which helps keep Americans’ gas prices down. Trump regularly describes US trade deficits as subsidies to other countries or losses to those countries, and he has done the same when talking about Canada. But having a trade deficit with Canada doesn’t mean the US is giving Canada free money. Rather, it means the US spent more to import Canadian products in a given year than Canada spent to import American products. And the US deficit with Canada is largely the result of the US bringing in a lot of one Canadian product: about 3.9 million barrels of crude oil per day on average in 2023. Trump argued Tuesday that “we don’t need anything” from Canada, but heavy crude from the Alberta oil sands is in high demand by US refineries, mostly in the Midwest, that are designed to process heavy crude – into products like gasoline and diesel – rather than the lighter crude the US tends to extract domestically. “If (hypothetically) Canadian oil were not available, many US refineries would struggle to find heavy crude elsewhere, and they might even stop operating in such a scenario. Historically, Venezuela had been a large producer of heavy crude, but Venezuela’s oil industry is a shadow of its former self,” Pavel Molchanov, an energy expert who is an investment strategy analyst at Raymond James, said in an email. “So, in fact, importing Canadian oil helps protect jobs in the US refining industry.Furthermore, US refining companies appreciate the fact that Canadian heavy crude is cheaper than the light sweet crude that is produced in Texas and Louisiana.” Trump chided Canada for failing to meet NATO’s guideline of having each member country spend 2% of its gross domestic product on defense; Canada’s failure to hit the target has been a bipartisan concern in the US for years. Trump told reporters Thursday: “They pay less than 1%. They’re about the lowest payer in NATO. They’re supposed to pay much more. They haven’t been paying.” Facts First: Trump was wrong when he said Canada spends “less than 1%” of GDP on defense, though it’s true that Canada has consistently fallen short of the 2% target. Official NATO figures show Canada spent an estimated 1.37% of GDP on defense in 2024, up from an estimated 1.31% in 2023. Canada was above 1% for the entirety of Trump’s first presidency, ranging from 1.44% in 2017 to 1.29% in 2019. There’s a solid basis for Trump’s claim that Canada is “about the lowest payer in NATO.” In terms of defense spending as a percentage of GDP, NATO’s preferred metric, Canada was 5th lowest in 2024 out of the 31 members with a standing army (another member, Iceland, does not have a standing army). Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, also pressed Canada to increase its defense spending, which Trudeau has done. But Canadian defense policy expert Stephen Saideman noted in an email that in absolute terms – not factoring in the size of each member’s economy – Canada is actually one of NATO’s largest spenders on defense; it was 8th highest in 2024 out of 31 members excluding Iceland. “Despite spending less than 2%, Canada is still one of the biggest spenders on military stuff – its economy is larger than most NATO members, so in absolute terms, it buys and spends a lot,” said Saideman, the Paterson Chair in International Affairs at Carleton University in Ottawa and director of the Canadian Defence and Security Network. Trudeau, who announced last week that he plans to resign as prime minister when his Liberal Party selects a new leader, said last year that his government would continue to increase defense spending and declared – without laying out a specific plan – that Canada expects to hit the 2% threshold by 2032. Twenty-three NATO members were expected to be at or above the threshold in 2024, a record, after a spending spike among European members following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Trump said of Canada on Tuesday: “They don’t, essentially, have a military. They have a very small military.” He repeated on Thursday­: “They have virtually no military. They have a very small military.” Facts First: Canadian defense experts and the Canadian government itself have raised concerns about the size and readiness of Canada’s military, but that military very much exists – with more than 63,000 regular servicemembers as of fall 2024, plus more than 20,000 reservists. The Canadian military has fought alongside the US military in the war in Afghanistan (in which more than 150 Canadian troops died), the war against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, the Gulf War, the Korean War and both world wars (in which tens of thousands of Canadian troops died), in addition to participating in other wars and peacekeeping missions. The Canadian military and US military jointly operate the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and conduct numerous other activities together, including ongoing strategic initiatives in Latvia and the South China Sea. We won’t render a fact-check verdict here because Trump qualified his claims with the words “essentially” and “virtually.” And he’s entitled to question, as Canadian politicians have, whether Canada’s military is strong enough. But Canada certainly isn’t comparable to military-free Iceland. “Canada’s military is not NATO’s largest, but it has regularly made significant contributions, such as holding down Kandahar, one of the toughest places in Afghanistan, with little help until Obama’s surge. It is playing a significant role as the leader of the NATO effort in Latvia,” Saideman said. “It is in the middle of a major recapitalization effort that will give it 88 F-35s, 15 frigates, and more. So, smaller than it should be? Sure. Very small? No. None? Not at all.” Trump claimed in a social media post last Monday that if Canada “merged” with the US, Canada would, among other things, “be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Canada, which has the world’s largest coastline, has never been surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships, let alone been “constantly” surrounded. In fact, a smattering of Russian and Chinese military ships and jets, as well as Chinese research vessels viewed with suspicion by Canada and the US, have been occasionally spotted in recent years in the vicinity of Alaska – and have been monitored or intercepted by the Canadian and US militaries. The Canadian government warned in December that among the “potential threats” in its Arctic region were “increased Russian activity in Canadian air approaches” and “China’s regular deployment of dual-use – having both research and military application – research vessels and surveillance platforms to collect data.” But a Canadian expert on Arctic security, Trent University professor P. Whitney Lackenbauer, said “there is absolutely no open source evidence that Canada is constantly surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships.” He said Trump’s claim is “misinformation” unless he is disclosing some unknown classified intelligence. Lackenbauer said in an email: “When Chinese vessels have entered Canadian Arctic waters to conduct marine scientific research, they have acquired the requisite permits from the Government of Canada. There are no Russian fishing vessels (or intelligence-collecting boats masquerading as fishing vessels) active in Canadian waters like there are off the coast of Alaska – a simple glance at the map of the Arctic will explain the difference in geographical proximity – and there have been no Chinese-Russian joint exercises in or near Canadian waters as there have been off the coast of Alaska.” Arctic security expert Rob Huebert, interim director of the University of Calgary’s Centre for Military Security and Strategic Studies, said in an interview that Chinese military ships have come “much closer” to the US than Canada. He added: “If you’re talking about the real geography, you guys are more threatened right now than we are, with the Aleutian Islands … Technically speaking, the vessels that you are talking about are actually coming up and surrounding Alaska, not Canada.” Huebert argued that the Trump administration would itself worsen the Chinese and Russian naval threat to Canada in the Arctic if it decided to aggressively press the longstanding US argument that Canada’s claim to the Northwest Passage is “illegitimate,” as Trump’s then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared in 2019, and that the passage is actually international waters."
Fact check: President Biden defends Hunter Biden pardon with false and inaccurate claims,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/politics/fact-check-president-biden-hunter-pardon/index.html,"President Joe Biden recently made several false and inaccurate claims to defend his controversial decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden. In a wide-ranging interview with USA Today, the president also made a false claim about inflation. A full transcript of the interview was released Wednesday. Biden issued the unconditional pardon to Hunter in December, sparing his son from a potential prison sentence for tax and gun convictions. The far-reaching pardon also shielded Hunter from future prosecution by the incoming Trump administration. Here’s a breakdown of Biden’s comments on his son’s case, the rationale behind his clemency decision, and his other remarks on the economy. In the interview, Biden provided his most extensive comments yet about his controversial decision to pardon his son, after repeatedly promising not to grant clemency. Biden insisted, according to USA Today’s transcript, “I meant what I said,” about his pledge not to pardon Hunter, “but then I found out about two factors.” Before examining that, it’s crucial to note that both factors were widely known long before Biden issued the pardon on December 1. But Hunter’s team raised the same points in a post-election “white paper” that may have caught Biden’s eye. The first factor pertained to Hunter’s federal tax indictment. (He pleaded guilty in September to charges including tax evasion, filing false tax returns, and failing to file and pay his taxes on time.) Biden said he learned that Hunter “had paid all his taxes,” “paid it all,” and “paid the back taxes.” It’s true that Hunter belatedly paid $2 million in taxes, including penalties and fees. But the judge ruled that this didn’t impact whether Hunter broke tax laws, saying, “Evidence of late payment here is irrelevant to (Hunter’s) state of mind at the time he allegedly committed the charged crimes.” He barred Hunter from telling jurors about the $2 million because they could “improperly construe late payment as a defense to the charged crimes.” Special counsel David Weiss’ prosecutors have also vehemently pushed back on the idea that the $2 million made the IRS whole, as Biden suggested to USA Today. That’s because it covered the taxes Hunter owed, as reported on his federal tax returns. But he has since admitted to lying on some tax returns to reduce his bill with fraudulent business deductions. The second factor Biden raised was he said Hunter was unfairly prosecuted for lying about illegal drug use on an ATF background check form, and for possessing a gun while addicted to illegal drugs. Biden said: “On this purchasing a gun, at the time, you have to sign a form if you’re under the influence of anything. Well, I don’t even know whether they got straight on the signing of the form. But the point was, no one’s ever been tried on that. Nobody.” The ATF form does not ask “if you’re under the influence of anything,” while signing the paperwork, as Biden suggested. The form says, “are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to” marijuana or other controlled substances. In fact, prosecutors told jurors they didn’t need to find that Hunter was under the influence when he filled out the form, in order to reach a guilty verdict. Regarding Biden’s claim that “nobody” in US history has “ever been tried” on addiction-related paperwork charges like these – even Hunter’s own legal team hasn’t even made that argument. In their November “white paper,” Hunter’s attorneys more narrowly asserted that “no one has ever been charged in Delaware” under these same circumstances. Legal experts have said Biden has legitimate gripes, though, because charges of drug addicts lying on the form are usually brought in tandem with more serious offenses, like using the gun in a violent crime, or with aggravating factors, like if the suspect is a felon. “When those statutes are charged, they typically are accompanied by some other crime, like a drug offense or a violent crime,” CNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said about the statutes used against Hunter. “It is exceedingly rare – I can’t say never – but it’s exceedingly rare to see those addiction-related charges brought in isolation.” In the USA Today interview, Biden spoke about the gun at the center of his son’s case – a revolver Hunter bought in 2018 and possessed for 11 days. Biden claimed, “it got returned,” which is provably false, based on testimony and evidence from Hunter’s trial last June. Witness testimony, documentary evidence, and surveillance footage presented at trial demonstrated that Hunter’s sister-in-law and romantic partner, Hallie Biden, took the firearm from his car and threw it in a trash can outside a Delaware grocery store. A random elderly man later found the gun and took it home. The police got involved and eventually tracked down the man and recovered the weapon. It wasn’t “returned” by anyone tied to Hunter. Finally, while defending his son, Biden claimed, “He got former Attorneys General and former leaders in both parties, not office holders saying, ‘It’s not done, it’s not been done.’” Plenty of Democrats have argued that this case wouldn’t have been filed against Hunter if he wasn’t a Biden – including former Attorney General Eric Holder. But the White House couldn’t provide evidence backing up claims that Republican leaders have said the same. Asked about his handling of inflation, Biden touted the economic impact of major legislation he signed. He said, “We spent money doing it. But the fact is that we had a soft landing, no recession, and the interest rate was 9% when we came into office in the beginning. It was down to 2.34% now.” The White House made clear Biden meant to repeat his past claim that “the inflation rate” was 9% when he came into office, not say that “the interest rate” was 9%. But that’s still false – as CNN has pointed out when Biden made the claim last year. The year-over-year inflation rate in the pandemic-era month Biden became president, January 2021, was actually about 1.4%, not “9%.” It only hit 9% in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. In addition, the most recent year-over-year inflation rate that is currently available, for November 2024, was about 2.7%, not “2.34%.” Biden would be closer to correct about the current rate if he was speaking of the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which rose about 2.4% year-over-year in November. But that rate was about 1.6% in pandemic-era January 2021, so it still wouldn’t be accurate to say it was 9% when he took office. And that index never hit 9% under Biden, peaking at about 7.2% in June 2022. On Wednesday, a White House official emailed CNN the same comment the administration provided when Biden inaccurately said in 2024 that inflation was 9% when he became president. “The President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office. The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains,” the official said."
Pete Hegseth says US military bases should restore names of Confederate generals,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/politics/pete-hegseth-confederate-generals-military-bases/index.html,"Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of defense, has voiced strong opposition to removing the names of Confederate generals from US military bases, repeatedly saying the names should be changed back. Hegseth, a National Guard veteran and longtime Fox News host, has described the renaming efforts as “a sham,” “garbage,” and “crap” in various media appearances between 2021 and 2024 reviewed by CNN. Hegseth said the moves eroded military tradition and were part of what he characterized as a politically motivated progressive agenda infiltrating American institutions. Between 2022 and 2023, the names of nine US military bases previously dedicated to Confederate leaders were changed, the result of the National Defense Authorization Act passed at the end of the first Trump administration. Trump initially vetoed the bill, partly in protest over the renaming provision, but Congress overwhelmingly overrode the veto to pass the bill in January 2021  . As secretary of defense, Hegseth could advocate for reverting base names to their former Confederate names, but the changes would require congressional approval. Hegseth, whose Senate confirmation hearings begin January 14, has criticized other cultural shifts in the military, including allowing women to serve in combat roles and gay service members to serve openly  . Hegseth did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. During his 2024 book tour promoting “The War on Warriors,” Hegseth frequently criticized the decision to rename military bases, calling it an erasure of legacy and tradition. “We should change it back by the way,” he said emphatically while promoting his book when discussing North Carolina’s Fort Liberty – previously Fort Bragg – on a podcast. “We should change it back. We should change it back. We should change it back, because legacy matters. My uncle served at Bragg. I served at Bragg. It breaks a generational link.” Fort Bragg, one of the largest Army bases in the US, was named for Braxton Bragg, a general in the Confederacy and slave owner who lost nearly every battle he was involved in during the Civil War. A naming commission set-up by Congress to study renaming bases noted Bragg is “considered one of the worst generals of the Civil War,” and was “widely disliked in the pre-Civil War U.S. Army and within the Confederate Army by peers and subordinates alike.” The base, originally Camp Bragg, opened during World War I and was named by locals for Bragg, the only Civil War general from North Carolina. The base was renamed Fort Liberty in 2023. Trump has been adamant in his opposition to renaming bases honoring Confederate leaders. “I have been clear in my opposition to politically motivated attempts like this to wash away history and to dishonor the immense progress our country has fought for in realizing our founding principles,” Trump said at the time of the legislation. Hegseth’s remarks are in keeping with a broader opposition expressed by incoming Trump officials to a range of cultural policies they view as overly progressive. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the two billionaires tasked with slashing government waste, are expected to recommend an agency-wide purge of spending on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as CNN has previously reported. In an interview with Megyn Kelly in early December, Hegseth gave a laundry list of DEI-related initiatives that he says Trump has told him to remove at the Pentagon. “Clean house of the woke crap,” Hegseth told Kelly. “All that stuff. Climate stuff, the (critical race theory), the DEI and genderism. Get rid of it.” As CNN previously reported in December, Hegseth was once critical of allowing openly gay troops in the military – calling it part of a “Marxist agenda.” He has also expressed opposition to women serving in combat roles, describing it as detrimental to military readiness. Since CNN’s report Hegseth has softened both positions. In one interview in 2021 with Israeli podcaster Yair Netanyahu, the son of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hegseth argued that efforts to rename American military bases represented a trend of viewing the United States solely through the lens of its past sins. “It’s that view that America is defined by its sins of the past,” he said. “That the only lens through which you should view America is it was stolen from Indians – from Native Americans and built on the backs of slaves. Therefore, anyone who was a slave owner, anyone who was a part of, you know, didn’t go far enough in their time should be canceled.” Hegseth took particular aim at retired Gen. Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accusing him of supporting the renaming efforts for political reasons. Hegseth questioned why Milley, who previously commanded Fort Hood, did not raise objections to Confederate base names earlier in his career. Hegseth’s criticisms align with Trump’s known hostility toward Milley, whom Trump has called “a f**king idiot,” and suggested could be executed for treason. “Why wasn’t he screaming about the racist base?” Hegseth added on the June 2024 podcast. “Oh my goodness. How in the world am I gonna send troopers through basic training at a racist base? It must be changed. It’s a sham. He showed up and he did it as a sham to kowtow to all the chattering class in Washington, DC, and he should be called out for it.” In another June 2024 interview, Hegseth referred to renaming the bases as “crap” and “garbage.” “I emailed my company commander from my infantry training, which was at Fort Benning, which is no longer Fort Benning,” he said in 2024. “It’s Fort Moore. And Hal Moore’s a great guy. But like, there’s also a generational link that breaks when you rename Benning and Bragg. Like, where’d you serve? Bragg, where’d you serve Benning? Where’d you serve now Liberty, like, it’s just, it’s garbage. It’s all, it’s just, let’s just crap all over it.” Hegseth was discussing Fort Benning - now Fort Moore - named for Confederate Gen. Henry L. Benning."
KFile: Pete Hegseth spread baseless conspiracy theories that January 6 attack was carried out by leftist groups,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/17/politics/kfile-pete-hegseth-conspiracy-theories-january-6/index.html,"President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, justified the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack and spread baseless conspiracy theories claiming the initial break-in was a false flag operation carried out by leftist groups disguised as Trump supporters. In comments made immediately after the riot and in the days and weeks leading up to it, Hegseth also amplified false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, a narrative that fueled the violence at the Capitol that day. Hegseth’s remarks are among a number of controversial statements he’s made related to national security issues, including suggesting US troops should be deployed in response to domestic riots, endorsing waterboarding as an interrogation tactic, opposing women serving in combat roles and saying that gay people being allowed to serve openly in the military reflected a “Marxist” agenda. Four days after the Capitol riot, Hegseth appeared on a podcast hosted by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called “Newt’s World.” Hegseth, who was then a Fox News host and prominent conservative media figure, downplayed the violence, defended the rioters’ motivations, and criticized the media for rejecting baseless claims of a stolen election. He also seized on debunked reports claiming that the riot was instigated by the leftist group known as Antifa. Hegseth alleged that he had seen evidence firsthand that Antifa members disguised themselves as Trump supporters at the riot. “There are reports, you know, in the New York Post and elsewhere. And just from, you know, common sense, that Antifa folks took advantage of this to try to get to the front and try to agitate and create openings for themselves,” Hegseth said. “They want chaos, ultimately,” Hegseth said of Antifa members. “I could even spot it. You can see the helmets where there’s a Donald Trump bumper sticker on the back, quickly put on it so they could look like they wanted to stop the steal. But what they really wanted to do was further the narrative.” Hegseth was citing now debunked articles. He didn’t comment for this story. His statements echo widely debunked conspiracy theories propagated by some in conservative circles after the Capitol attack. Investigations by the FBI have found no evidence that Antifa played any role in the riot. Antifa, short for “anti-fascist,” is a loosely organized far-left movement that opposes right-wing ideology and is known for sometimes engaging in confrontational or violent tactics. As previously reported by CNN, the conspiracy about Antifa and the Capitol was promoted by a large roster of right-wing people and entities. That included some of Fox News’ most prominent personalities. Other proponents included right-wing television networks Newsmax and One America News Network, Trump’s then personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Republican members of Congress including then-Reps. Mo Brooks and Matt Gaetz. Hegseth’s selection to lead the Pentagon has been clouded by a number of factors, including his decision in 2020 to pay an undisclosed amount in a settlement to a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2017. Hegseth strongly denies her allegations. Trump has maintained his staunch support for Hegseth, who joined Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance at the Army-Navy football game last weekend. Hegseth has also softened some of his past statements in recent days, saying he supports gay people and women serving in the military. Earlier on Gingrich’s podcast, Hegseth absolved Trump supporters of responsibility for the violence, portraying the crowd as peaceful and unaware of the initial breaches. “The mindset of these people was not overtly radical; it wasn’t violent at all,” Hegseth claimed. “In fact, if you break down the timeline, Newt, much of what was happening on Capitol Hill – the first incursions breaking through the barricades – happened while Donald Trump was still speaking.” Shorty after 1 p.m. on January 6, pro-Trump protesters broke down barriers to enter a restricted area on Capitol grounds. The breaking through of barriers came in the minutes before Trump was wrapping up his speech. Speaking with Gingrich, Hegseth also seemingly justified the actions of the rioters by suggesting their motivations were rooted in legitimate grievances. “What did people think was going to happen?” Hegseth said, dismissing widespread condemnation of the deadly riot. “I didn’t like the knee-jerk, pearl-clutching response across the spectrum.” Hegseth expressed frustration with Republicans who condemned Trump and his supporters, as well as the media for rejecting false claims of election fraud. “I talked to the people on the mall, I’ve talked to ‘em a lot,” Hegseth said. “Listen, they believe the election was stolen. They wish there were more recourses. They’ve watched what happens, they’ve seen stories be suppressed before – Hunter Biden. “I mean, the amazing extent to which the media has now taken to taking the official line of secretaries of states or governors and saying, ‘Well, this has been fact-checked and debunked because the government officials are telling us that it’s not true,’” he added. “When’s the last time that’s what the media was supposed to do – reflect and project back upon the populace what government officials are saying because it enhances their narrative? It’s unbelievable,” he added. Hegseth also voiced support for the Trump campaign’s claims of voter fraud in 2020. In December that year, speaking on Kevin McCullough’s radio show on AM970 The Answer to promote his book, “The War on Warriors,” Hegseth claimed that testimony and evidence presented revealed “something massive going on underneath.” There is no evidence of massive fraud in any states or across the country, as acknowledged by Republican election officials and Trump’s own attorney general at the time, Bill Barr. Trump and his supporters filed more than 60 lawsuits in six key battleground states after the election and lost every case. Hegseth praised Trump’s legal team for its efforts and called for continued investigations, discovery, and an inquiry from the Department of Justice into the fraud claims. “You can’t watch, listen to, see the testimony that’s being given, and – if you’re being honest about it and willing to actually engage with it – watch the videos, listen to the testimonies, and feel like there isn’t something massive going on underneath,” Hegseth said. He also criticized the media. “The problem is… the group think of the so-called mainstream left-wing media. It’s not just, ‘Here’s our narrative.’ It’s ‘Here’s our narrative, which is there is no massive widespread fraud.’” None of these comments were by Hegseth while on Fox News, where he was a host at the time. The network played a key role in promoting baseless voter fraud claims after the 2020 election, ultimately settling a defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems in 2023 for $787.5 million over its promotion of election conspiracy theories. Hegseth continued pushing claims that the election was rigged through mail-in ballots, telling Gingrich on his January 2021 podcast it was a cause for the riot at the Capitol. “I didn’t anticipate the rigging in the extra constitutional way,” he said. “They would do mail-in balloting and signature check and all of the guardrails that came off came off. And so if the ballot box isn’t there, that’s what you saw.” “You saw regular, rational, hardworking, tax-paying business owners on the grounds carrying American flags and Trump flags saying, ‘I don’t know what else to do. I don’t know where else to go. I don’t feel like there’s another politician out there that is willing to go all the way to the mat to stare the media to the face and call ‘em the enemy of the state,’” he said. Later that year, Hegseth repeatedly declined to say if Trump lost the 2020 election during a contentious exchange with a Democratic lawmaker that July on Fox News."
Electoral College: How it’s changed this year,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/17/politics/electoral-college-votes-what-matters/index.html,"More than 150 million Americans cast ballots for president in November, but it’s 538 electors who actually elect the president when they meet in state capitols every four years. That archaic process, known as the Electoral College, has endured multiple repeal efforts and one very serious attempt to undermine it in 2020. But the Electoral College survives. When Congress gathers on January 6 to count and certify the electoral votes, it’s likely to be a much less dramatic affair in 2025 than it was in 2021, simply because President-elect Donald Trump won the election and is not contesting the results. His Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, is also respecting the will of voters this year. Another contributor to the less dramatic Electoral College meetings this year is that Congress came together in 2022 to pass a bipartisan law, the Electoral Count Reform Act, clarifying how exactly the process should work and making it harder to dispute the results. Here’s what to know: When voters cast ballots on Election Day, they are actually selecting a slate of electors tied to that candidate. The winning slate of electors in each state votes for president in December. The 538 electors are equal to the number of US senators (100), House members (435) and three additional electors for voters in Washington, DC. The number of electoral votes each state gets can change after the census every 10 years. It is tied to the number of House members plus two senators each state has in Congress. Usually, the popular vote winner matches the Electoral College winner, but not always. Twice this century, in 2000 and 2016, the person elected president got the support of fewer American voters than the person who lost the Electoral College. Warning: The legalese below is going to get a bit complicated. But here’s how things are supposed to work: ► Election Day occurs. By law, presidential elections occur on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, which was November 5 in 2024. ► Governors issue seven Certificates of Ascertainment. These are seven documents confirming election results from their states and officially naming slates of electors. For 2024, the deadline was December 11, which was six days before the Electoral College meets. These certificates include the names of electors and which presidential candidate they are pledged to support. Each state’s certificate looks a little bit different. Nevada’s even has a blockchain-powered digital seal. One copy is immediately sent to the National Archives, which posts it online. The other six are kept for the Electoral College meeting. ► Electors meet and vote. The Electoral College meeting occurs on the Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December, which was December 17 in 2024. Each state’s electors meet in their state and cast their votes. They all sign six copies of a Certificate of Vote that’s attached to six copies of the Certificates of Ascertainment, which are also then sent to the Archives. In addition to setting those December dates in stone, the new law requires that slates of electors must be selected on Election Day and that procedures for selecting electors, which vary by law from state to state, must be in place before Election Day. All of that is meant to ward against a repeat of 2020, when Trump and his allies tried to appoint alternate slates of electors. Requiring electors to be selected on Election Day, unless there is something like a major natural disaster, guards against the idea that state legislatures could pick their own electors after Election Day. Also, while some states have laws that require the electors to support the winner of the popular vote in their state, not all do. Occasionally, electors go rogue and support someone other than their candidate. These are known as “faithless electors.” While there were seven successful faithless electors in 2016, there were none in 2020. The National Archives has a lot more detail on the process. And the Campaign Legal Center has a rundown of what changed as a result of the Electoral Count Reform Act. But we’re not done yet. Now things move to the nation’s capital. The six copies of the Certificates of Ascertainment and the Certificate of Vote are sent to various places. The vice president gets one, the chief election officer in each state gets two, the archivist of the US gets two and the federal district judge where the electors meet in their states gets one. Congress counts the votes. Senators and House members come together on January 6 in the House chamber. Two House members and two senators are appointed as “tellers” who read the vote tallies aloud, state by state. Lawmakers can object. Lawmakers still have the ability to object to the votes from any state, but the new law requires one-fifth of the lawmakers in each chamber (87 House members and 20 senators) to sign on to an objection, as opposed to four years ago, when it took only one person from each chamber. If a sufficient number of lawmakers agrees, the two chambers split up to debate the objection. In order to reject electoral votes, a majority vote in both the House and Senate is required. The vice president, as president of the US Senate, oversees the counting of votes. But the role has been clarified since four years ago, when Trump’s first vice president, Mike Pence, followed the Constitution and refused Trump’s request to reject votes in key states he lost. In 2021, Pence’s position was that the vice president could not unilaterally reject electoral votes. Now, the new law explicitly states that the role of the vice president is “ministerial.” This year, Harris will have to oversee the counting of votes that confirm her defeat. It’s a rare indignity. While Pence oversaw the counting of votes that confirmed he would not be reelected as vice president, Al Gore was the last person to oversee his own presidential loss, back in January 2001. The new president takes office on January 20, 2025."
Why the clock is already ticking on the new GOP congressional majority,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/politics/congressional-majority-trifecta-trump-analysis/index.html,"The Republican Congress that began its first full week of work on Monday is already operating on borrowed time – unless the GOP can defy one of the most powerful patterns of recent US politics. Republicans begin the year in Washington at high tide, with unified control, after Donald Trump takes office on January 20, of the White House, the House and the Senate. But the past five times a president went into a midterm election with unified control of government, voters have revoked it. No president has maintained control of both congressional chambers through a midterm election since Jimmy Carter in 1978. Unless Republicans can break that streak in 2026, that means Trump and his Congressional allies will have only two years to pass their most significant legislation – the same squeeze that has confronted, and constricted, presidents now for decades. Susie Wiles, Trump’s incoming White House chief of staff, appeared to implicitly acknowledge that reality in an interview with Axios released on Monday, when she described the two years between his inauguration and the 2026 midterms as the critical period for advancing his agenda. The inability of both parties to maintain unified control through a midterm election for such a long period is unprecedented in American political history. Prior to the recent experience, the most consecutive times a party went into a midterm with unified control of government and lost it was four. Those losing streaks occurred during two separate periods of maximum political instability in the 19th century. The shorter shelf life of unified government in modern times has almost without notice shaped behavior in both the White House and Congress – subtly discouraging bipartisan compromise and pushing the majority party to stuff the top priorities of each incoming president into one massive legislative package, as Republicans are poised to attempt again this year. The current run also stamps our modern period as another era shaped by the incapacity of either party to establish a lasting advantage over the other, despite the repeated hopes of each newly elected president that his victory signals the beginning of a lasting realignment. The rapid and severe shifts in advantage between the two parties have become so head-spinning that “you need a neck brace now to observe American electoral politics,” said Steve Israel, a former Democratic representative from New York who chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Each time a party takes power with unified control of government, it hopes to break this pattern of rapid turnover. But, as Wiles’ comments  suggest, there’s a growing recognition that they probably will not. “The basic expectation has shifted in the modern era,” said David Price, a political scientist and former Democratic representative from North Carolina. Even when it is not explicitly discussed, that shifting expectation has changed behavior in both the majority party holding unified control and the minority party hoping to dislodge them, Price and other analysts told me. “You are making decisions knowing that the tide is going to change,” said Israel. For one thing, Price said, more senior members who might have considered retirement in an earlier era when they fall into the minority are now more willing to stick around on the expectation that they will soon hold the gavels again. “It kept me going, and I don’t think I’m atypical,” Price, who retired from Congress two years ago, said. “In the first two Trump years, our whole leadership … was all at the point where we might ride off into the sunset and we decided just the opposite because we anticipated correctly there was going to be one hell of a midterm. That was a major incentive in terms of our planning of our own careers.” The willingness of so many members to run again while in the minority, Price added, can become “a self-fulfilling prophecy” because it provides a party with strong candidates and reduces the number of open seats they must defend. “The fact that Democrats were confident and signing up for another round was a factor in helping us get there,” he said. The frequency of turnover has also discouraged the minority party from cooperating with the majority party, especially in the House. When Democrats held their unbroken  40-year House majority from 1955 to 1994, Republican leaders, such as Robert Michel of Illinois, routinely worked with the majority to influence their legislation. Now, both parties are less interested in working with and influencing the other party’s legislation than displacing them and writing their own. “This recent history is informing attitudes and planning on Capitol Hill,” Israel said. “It used to be you’d go to Congress, you’d find a friend on the other side of the aisle, you had a long term view. Now no matter what happens, the prevailing sense (is) we just have to wait it out for another two years” before winning the majority again. The opposite dynamic is evident in the behavior of the majority parties during this era of more fragile control. Almost always over the past few decades, during a new president’s first two years, the party holding unified control has sought to cram as many of its highest priorities as possible into the special legislative tool known as reconciliation. When using reconciliation, the majority party doesn’t need to win any support from the minority party because it can be passed with a simple majority in both chambers. Ordinarily the Senate’s majority party – unless it holds at least 60 seats – would need to negotiate with the minority party to break a filibuster; but a reconciliation bill cannot be filibustered, which eliminates the necessity of compromising with the minority. Reconciliation was the mechanism the party holding unified control used to pass the Bush and Trump tax cuts, as well as Obama’s Affordable Care Act and Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act – and it’s the tool Republican leaders are planning to rely upon again this year to advance Trump’s top priorities on taxes, energy, immigration and spending cuts. (At times, presidents have recorded bipartisan achievements while holding unified control, such as Biden’s infrastructure and semiconductor production bills, but those have been the exception.) The heightened risk of losing unified control, and with it the ability to drive legislation, in the next midterm election after a presidential victory has become a valuable lever for presidents hoping to corral recalcitrant legislators behind their agenda, Price said. “There was the sense we damn well better get it done in those first two years and that added all kinds of urgency and focus to our legislative efforts,” he said. “That’s not all bad. Congress needs forcing mechanisms and this is a major one: that you may be out of power next year.” Louisa Terrell, who served as Biden’s first White House legislative director and the deputy director for Obama, said that both administrations were keenly aware that unified control of government had grown more fragile. “There was not a consistent dialogue with a specific expiration date – that we had to get this done by ‘X date,’” she said. “But the conversation (with legislators) was we have no time to waste and that we have to try to see what can work in this time frame.” Former Republican Virginia Rep. Tom Davis, who chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that unified control encouraged more party discipline through another mechanism: eliminating excuses for inaction. “When you control everything,” he said, “everybody who’s mad about anything knows who is to blame.” The risk of alienating a coalition’s base voters, he said, is especially acute when leaders cannot blame divided control of Congress for any failures to pass a top party priority. For the Republicans who will hold unified control after Trump’s inauguration later this month, Davis said, “Politically, the worst thing would be to get this and not produce, because when your base collapses, everything goes.” That will likely be a major argument for Republican leaders this year, he adds, particularly as they try to corral their razor-thin House majority behind what will likely be a sprawling reconciliation bill. The shorter lifespan of governments with unified party control is a modern phenomenon. Through the heart of the 20th century, it was much more common for either party to enjoy longer periods holding both the White House and Congress. That allowed them more time to pass their agenda, cement their priorities into law and lastingly reshape the country’s direction. Overall, from 1896 through 1968, one party or the other simultaneously held the White House, the House and the Senate for 58 of those 72 years. Twice over that span one party maintained unified control of Washington for 14 consecutive years (Republicans around the turn of the 20th century under William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and Democrats during the Depression and World War II under Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman); Republicans controlled all the branches in Washington for the entire decade of the 1920s and Democrats did so behind Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson through most of the 1960s. Since then, though, it has become far more difficult for either side to establish unified control of the White House and Congress – and much harder to defend it when they do. Even counting the next two years in which Republicans will exercise complete control over Washington, by 2026, one party or the other will have held unified control for just 18 of the past 58 years. Holding unified control of Congress and the White House through a midterm election has become virtually impossible for both parties. Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, as well as Trump in his first victory, all had the same experience: Each man was elected with unified control of the House and Senate but lost the House two years later in his first midterm (in 1994 for Clinton, 2010 for Obama, 2018 for Trump and 2022 for Biden.) Clinton also lost the Senate. George W. Bush’s experience represents the slight variation on the theme. He, too, was elected president with unified control of the House and Senate in 2000. But the GOP at that point had only a 50-50 Senate majority and lost control of the chamber a few months into Bush’s term when Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords quit the Republican Party   to declare himself an independent; that shifted the Senate majority to the Democrats. As a result, Bush headed into the 2002 midterm without unified control of Congress. Republicans in that election held the House and won back the Senate, and preserved their majorities in both chambers in the 2004 presidential election. But in the 2006 election, the first time Bush went into a midterm with unified control, Democrats swept to the majorities in both the House and Senate. Thus, each of the past five times a president went into a midterm with unified control of Congress, voters have revoked it. Two moments of maximum political instability during the 19th century provide the only precedent when unified control of government was as fleeting as it has been since the 1990s. As the country careered into the Civil War during the mid-19th century, presidents were elected with unified control of Congress in 1840, 1844, 1852 and 1856 – and then promptly lost it two years later. (In 1848, Whig President Zachary Taylor never had unified control of Congress.) That streak was broken when Abraham Lincoln, and his newly formed Republican Party, maintained unified control in the 1862 election, the first midterm after his victory in 1860 (and in the middle of the Civil War). The other longest streak of instability came during the Gilded Age in the late 19th century. Presidents from both parties were elected with unified control of Congress in 1872, 1880, 1888 and 1892 – and again all lost it two years later. (The presidents elected in 1876 and 1884 never had unified control.) That streak was broken when Republicans defended their unified control in 1898, two years after the election of President William McKinley (who Trump has lately cited as a role model). What both those 19th century periods of instability have in common is that they each unfolded while neither party appeared capable of resolving the biggest challenge facing the country: the slide toward Civil War in the first case, and the severe strains created by industrialization and urbanization in the second. Observers attribute the modern fragility of unified control partly to the same dynamic – the inability of either party to convince voters they can resolve the country’s biggest problems, particularly the long-term strain on the living standards of average families that dates back to the 1970s. Israel, like other analysts, notes that most US elections since 2006 –  both presidential and midterm contests – have essentially reversed the outcome of the election two years before. Voters, for instance, gave Democrats big House and Senate majorities behind Obama in 2008, then turned sharply toward the GOP in the 2010 “tea party” landslide, before shifting back to Obama in 2012 and then tilting toward Republicans again in 2014. “It’s the unique convergence of voter anxiety, economic insecurity and overall instability,” Israel said. “Voters are just looking for a solution, and every two years they think the solution they chose two years before isn’t working.” Rising political polarization has also intensified this instability in two distinct respects. The widening gap between the policy priorities of the two parties, many political analysts believe, has compounded the risk that when either party has unified control, it will advance an agenda too extreme to maintain support among the remaining swing voters in the electorate. “Generally, voters in midterms vote to put a check on the president rather than giving him a blank check, because presidents and parties tend to overread their mandates,” Davis said. “When you move past the voters too quickly, they will put the brakes on.” The other way polarization has undermined unified control is by systematically shrinking the size of congressional majorities. Because so many states and congressional districts are now seemingly locked down for each party, even in favorable elections, both sides typically have been able to secure only very narrow majorities. Only three times in the 21st century has either party held at least 55 Senate seats; that compares to seven times either reached that threshold in the 10 Congresses from 1980 to 2000. The current Republican House majority of 220 seats (which could shrink further in special elections coming this spring) is the smallest in nearly a century, and follows back-to-back 222 seat majorities for Democrats and Republicans from 2021-2024. “The days of 30-vote majorities,” said Israel, “are probably over for the time being.” Even the parties that successfully defended unified control in the past usually suffered losses in the House and Senate during midterm elections; the difference for them was that their majorities were big enough that they could lose some seats and maintain control. Now the parties have almost no cushion to sustain losses and preserve control, especially in the House. Trump and the GOP House and Senate leadership teams presiding over their party’s slim majorities are the latest leaders trying to navigate this obstacle course. They begin by expressing  optimism that if they deliver on their agenda, they can break the recent streak of voters rescinding unified control from every president who has carried it into a midterm for the past three decades. But, in either party, very few people will be surprised in two years if they cannot."
Biden offers a first draft of his foreign policy achievements,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/politics/joe-biden-foreign-policy-speech/index.html,"President Joe Biden on Monday defended his foreign policy achievements in office, offering his own first draft of history on how his presidency has affected security at home and US relationships abroad as he prepares to depart a career in public service spanning more than half a century. Biden sought to frame his presidency as a transformational one for American power abroad, saying in a capstone foreign policy address that he was handing off a nation better-positioned to compete in a new era to President-elect Donald Trump than the one he inherited from Trump four years ago. “New challenges will certainly emerge in the months and years ahead, but even so, it’s clear my administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play, and we’re leaving them and America more friends, stronger alliances. These adversaries are weaker and under pressure. An America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and missions,” Biden said in remarks at the State Department, one week before Trump takes the oath of office for a second term. He heralded his administration’s actions, saying – in an implicit critique of Trump – that under his leadership, “The United States is winning the worldwide competition compared to four years ago. America is stronger. Our alliances are stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker. We have not gone to war to make these things happen.” The speech offered a bookend for Biden, who addressed the State Department early in his term, laying out his foreign policy vision. Biden highlighted his efforts to bolster alliances, pointing to a strengthened NATO, partnerships in the Indo-Pacific, the defense pact among the US, Australia, and the United Kingdom, and the Quad alliance with Japan, Australia, and India. For all of Biden’s proclamations about a stronger America, however, the subtext to his address was the imminent return of Trump to the Oval Office. Biden heralded strengthened alliances and restored American influence across the globe – ideals that he has accused Trump of undermining. Much of Biden’s foreign policy legacy – from Ukraine to the Middle East – could depend on Trump’s decisions in the coming months. He detailed the state of conflicts abroad. On Ukraine, Biden said his administration “laid the foundation to the next administration so they can protect the bright future of the Ukrainian people,” comments that come amid major questions for the future of US aid for the war-torn country. Iran, he added, is “weaker than it’s been in decades” under his watch. And the US is “in a better strategic position for long-term competition with China,” he said. Biden defended his administration’s decision to end America’s longest war and withdraw US troops from Afghanistan, leading to a chaotic exit, the killing of 13 American service members in a bombing attack, and political disaster during his first year in office. “I saw no reason to keep thousands of servicemen in Afghanistan,” Biden said, adding, “In my view, it was time to end the war and bring our troops home.” Biden offered insight into his views on the foreign policy priorities in the coming years under the next administration: A “just and lasting peace” in Ukraine; ensuring the fall of Bashar Assad does not lead to the resurgence of ISIS; preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons; and a conclusion to the Israel-Hamas conflict as outlined in a proposal months ago. He also charged the incoming administration to “stay in the lead” on artificial intelligence and ongoing leadership on clean energy, speaking in stark terms about what’s at stake. “I know some in the incoming administration, some are skeptical about the need for clean energy. They don’t even believe climate change is real. They must come from a different century. They’re wrong. They are dead wrong. It’s the single greatest existential threat to humanity,” he warned."
American Battleground: How a single state took Harris down and raised the new era of Trump,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/politics/american-battleground-trump-2024-victory/index.html,"When the sun falls from the darkening Washington, DC, sky, the electric crowd at Howard University appears certain it will rise brighter. Singing, cheering, linking arms and raising hands in the great outdoor quadrangle known as The Yard, they have come by the thousands to watch the election returns and witness history in a place where it has been made before. The historically Black university has produced legendary authors and actors, esteemed scientists, the titanic Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and the groundbreaking woman for whom the rapturous throngs have rallied tonight. “And every time we hear a mention of Kamala Harris winning another state this crowd goes crazy!” a local television reporter says to her camera. Academically, every soul here knows the vice president could lose. But in the way of true believers in every political campaign, they feel she is destined to win; that the polls will clang shut east to west and acclaim will echo back from the far ocean, across the Rockies and Plains, through the farms and industrial towns to the nation’s capital, where their candidate will become the first woman elected president of the United States. Her whole campaign, after all, has been like a movie, and that’s how movies end. The fact that Harris — a Black and Asian American woman — will crush the man many Democrats see as dismissive of women and non-Whites, former President Donald Trump, is a delicious detail they will savor all their lives. “… We’re going to be here all night bringing you coverage,” the reporter goes on, “so stay tuned!” “They were feeling so confident,” says CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, who was also in the crowd. “They really thought they had it in the bag.” The candidate is a few miles away at the US Naval Observatory, the official residence of all vice presidents: close enough to dash to the rally for a victory speech, far enough to be free of the crowd’s intoxicating optimism. There and at her campaign offices everywhere, sober political scrutiny is being brought to bear on every report from every precinct. “All of us knew there were headwinds,” says Dan Kanninen, battleground state director for Harris. A political pro with a long pedigree, he is sharply aware of the worldwide trends against incumbents, the deep dissatisfaction of Americans with the direction of their country, and the late start Harris had been saddled with by President Joe Biden’s unexpected departure from the race in July. “Kamala Harris had a lot to do in 107 days that was hard to do in 107 days. She had to define herself, pick a VP, stake out her positions,” Kanninen says. He thought Harris could overcome it all, but the early exit polls confirm what other assessments have shown in the closing weeks. Her rapid-fire campaign is on a knife’s edge. Victory and defeat seem equally plausible. And something else in the numbers is troubling. “Donald Trump’s approval ratings were the highest they’d ever been,” Kanninen says. “He was at 41, 42,43, 44% his entire candidacy and his entire presidency. He was at 49 in this campaign.” Almost a thousand miles south at the former president’s Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, Trump is hosting a private watch party with the movers, shakers and wannabes of his circle, and he is seemingly nursing his own concerns. Earlier in the day, while casting his vote, he’d appeared tired, and he uncharacteristically nodded to the possibility of defeat. “I hear we are doing very well everywhere,” he said to the cameras, adding, “I may regret that statement, but I’m hearing that we’re doing very well.” He said he had not written a victory speech. “If I win, I know what I’m going to say, and I don’t even want to think about the losing part.” A reporter called out, “Regardless of what happens tonight, is this your last campaign? Are you done after this?” “Yeah, I would think so,” Trump said, looking at the floor. “I would think so.” Now it is evening, and by many accounts the most effective campaign team Trump has ever had is clawing through the data as feverishly as Harris’ contingent and sharing similar doubts. CNN’s Kristen Holmes is tracking the Trump team’s anxiety from the public watch party, which is also just a few minutes from the candidate’s citadel to allow a quick victory speech if warranted. “They believed he was going to win. However, it was very tight margins,” she says later, noting that Team Trump was gambling that the polls, which ever so slightly favored him in the closing days, were underestimating his strength just as in past campaigns. “They believed that (Trump’s supporters) were being under-polled. That the actual turnout would have Donald Trump winning. That meant if they were reading it wrong… he might not win.” What’s more, Harris’ ascendancy on the Democratic ticket — with her ecstatic crowds, celebrity backers, and mountains of fresh donations — had shaken the Republican candidate and his team from the start. “He himself saw a lot of the momentum around Kamala Harris,” Holmes says. “I think they believed that was slowing down, but there was still concern that there was some weird way she could pull it out.” The evening is a grind of returns and projections that are neither surprising nor consequential in that both campaigns have pre-counted the electoral hauls from states where their wins are unassailable. Trump takes Indiana and Kentucky. Harris wins Vermont. Trump takes Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Harris grabs Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Trump wins Ohio. Harris takes Illinois. Journalists stand in front of glowing maps analyzing the spreading patchwork of reds and blues. More than 35 million Americans are watching on TV; untold millions more are tracking the action online. Everyone has been told it will take a long night, perhaps long days, before a winner can be determined. At Howard, the huge crowd remains packed and buoyant. In Florida, conservative firebrand Tucker Carlson chats on a webcast with Trump super-supporter Elon Musk. When the richest man in the world’s small son giggles, Carlson joins in. “I like your laugh,” he says. “That’s the laugh of an honest man!” Behind the celebrations, the Harris and Trump number-crunchers are eyeing the battleground states that could go either way. Each election has them, and they change from time to time, but in this race, they are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Shortly after 10 p.m., the Tar Heel state arrives first at the tape. “CNN projects that Donald Trump will win the state of North Carolina,” says Jake Tapper as 16 electoral votes are added to Trump’s column and the watch party in West Palm Beach erupts. “Donald Trump now has 227 electoral votes. Kamala Harris has 153.” It is not seismic. Harris’ team knew North Carolina — which Trump twice won before — was a reach. She wins Oregon, New Mexico, Virginia and Hawaii. Then, at nearly midnight on the East Coast, another battleground is called. Georgia goes for Trump too. Still, not a huge surprise. The fact that it had flipped by a sliver from predictably red to blue for Biden in 2020 was unusual enough to make the Peach State a central part of Trump’s obsessive claim that Democrats must have cheated. Georgia was where then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani would falsely accuse a pair of poll workers of manipulating the results in Biden’s favor. The former New York mayor’s election lies would cost him his law license and a court would order him to pay the two women almost $150 million for defamation. Among items he was ordered to forfeit: his luxury apartment in Manhattan, a baseball jersey signed by Joe DiMaggio, a 1980s Mercedes that once belonged to the late film star Lauren Bacall, furniture, clothing, jewelry and more. With two battlegrounds now sizzling red on the map, the campaign teams go back to watching the remaining five, and one above all the others. Like armies circling each other at a distance, trying to find the most favorable spot for their inevitable clash, both campaigns in the final weeks have settled on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as critical to their victory. “What makes the state so important?” asks CNN’s Michael Smerconish. “Democrats dominate the two largest cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but spread out in between are rural territories favoring Republican candidates. And over time the state’s suburbs have become uniquely purple.” That perfectly balanced prize leaned Biden’s way in 2020 and secured his win. Pennsylvania is where Harris has spent enormous amounts of money and time trying to rally every voter she can find. Pennsylvania is where Trump was grazed by a bullet, cementing his image as a fighter for his fans and, polls suggest, giving a boost to his long-beleaguered approval ratings. Each campaign has mapped out many intricate combinations of demographics, geography, election law and ground forces to plot a winning path. Both parties have battalions of lawyers prepared for the court cases that will surely explode if the results are as tenuous as so many experts predict. The possibilities have been analyzed by pundits to the point of exhaustion. Yet for practical purposes, in every scenario Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes will live up to its name as the Keystone State. Polls have found the contest there agonizingly close, and the law itself is conspiring to prolong the suspense. “State law in Pennsylvania doesn’t permit our county election officials to begin processing … mail-in ballots until 7 a.m. on election morning,” Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania’s secretary of the commonwealth, explains. “Plenty of other states, red and blue alike, allow that process to begin days if not weeks in advance.” For all the efforts to suss out the true nature of this year’s electorate and divine what will actually happen, Pennsylvania began Election Day as a black box. Unknown. Unknowable. It is among the places most likely to drag the final decision of this race into an eternity of waiting. But that is not what happens. As results begin trickling, then flooding, in from Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Uniontown, Scranton, Bradford, Erie and beyond, a rumble begins in both the Harris and Trump camps. In short hours, it becomes an earthquake shaking the Democratic Party’s famed blue wall to its foundation. At 2:05 in the morning, Pennsylvania falls to Trump. Tapper is back on screen looking at the results from his home state and saying, “This is a huge, huge achievement for Donald Trump and a huge bucket of electoral votes.” Of more than 7 million votes cast in Pennsylvania, Trump beats Harris by just over 120,000. But it’s enough to brush away any doubts. At Howard University, the crowd is stunned. CNN’s Alvarez is working the phone, firing off emails, trying to get any read from the Harris team. Nothing. “The campaign had pretty much gone dark,” she says. “They were not responding to just about anything. I talked to one source who said once Pennsylvania was clearly going to Donald Trump, it was the nail in the coffin.” Wisconsin is so close it seems Harris might win, but Trump takes it, too. Then he wins Michigan. News outlets, adding up the electoral votes, begin calling the race. It is over. “Look what happened! Is this crazy?” Trump is crowing, beaming, exulting before a thunderous MAGA crowd in the wee hours, celebrating what many consider the election of a lifetime even as much of America is asleep, many unaware of the finality they will wake to in the morning. His team had braced, like everyone else, for a marathon slog to a declared victory, but now they stand startlingly at the finish line. “They were pretty confident by around 10 p.m. — 10 or 11 — that they had won the election,” Holmes says, but the team gently guarded against Trump making any premature declaration of victory as he had in his 2020 loss. Holmes says they told him, “We think you can win this. Let’s just wait it out and see.” Now he is free to proclaim his joy and relief to the world and he is bathing in the adulation. “I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,” he says. “This was a movement like nobody’s ever seen before … and frankly this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time … and now it’s going to reach a new level of importance because we’re going to help our country heal.” For the first time, not just the Electoral College, but more Americans have chosen him over anyone else to be president of the United States. “That means everything to him,” Holmes says based on her years of being around Trump. “To him, it means that he is the real winner. For him, it is a much bigger deal to win the popular vote because it says a lot of his ‘gut’ was right.” Right about the issues that would light up American voters. Right about the framing of his opponents. At 78, he is the oldest person ever to win the White House, yet he dances onstage as the crowd cheers. “Winning the popular vote was very nice,” he says. “Very nice, I’ll tell you.” Trump’s victory is decisive. He not only forced his party to keep him as its standard bearer after he left Washington in disgrace in 2021, but he also convinced a solid majority of the GOP he had never lost in 2020 anyway. He became the first Republican to win both the electoral and popular vote since President George W. Bush 20 years ago. Trump expanded his margins over 2020 and bested Harris in every battleground state. He led the ticket as his party recaptured the US Senate and held onto the House. He coaxed thousands of typically Democratic-leaning Black, brown and Asian Americans into his fold. He wagered against the advice of political pros on his ability to ignite passions among low-propensity voters and lure them to the polls — and his bet paid off. The new president-elect proclaims the might of his victory. “America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate!” But calling his win a landslide, as so many Trump allies do, is laughably false. Trump received slightly more than 77.3 million popular votes — just 1.5 percentage points more than Harris. It is one of the more anemic victories in a half-century and weak even in these hyper-partisan times, when close races are common. He collected 312 electoral votes, putting him in the lower half of all presidential winners — certainly more than Biden’s 306 in 2020, but far behind Barack Obama in 2008 with 365 and 2012 with 332. Bill Clinton was elected and reelected with electoral counts in the 370s. And the GOP’s hold on both chambers of Congress will be very narrow, making it potentially politically hazardous for the party to aggressively pursue the more radical aspects of Trump’s agenda. And it is worth noting a fine point from which Trump’s foes may take cold comfort: Most Americans who cast ballots in the 2024 presidential election did not want Trump to win. He clearly and fairly took the plurality of those votes, but the majority was split between Harris and a smattering of third-party candidates. Trump ended up with just under 50% of all the votes cast. He undeniably won. But despite his historic, remarkable comeback, once again Trump will be a minority president."
"Senate immigration bill aims to overturn Supreme Court precedent in a sea change for legal system, experts say",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/politics/laken-riley-immigration-enforcement-lawsuits/index.html,"Anti-immigrant state officials and federal judges would have new power to dictate immigration enforcement — including whether to detain individual migrants — under a GOP bill that has passed the House and is moving forward in the Senate with bipartisan support. The Laken Riley Act aims to overturn Supreme Court precedent and give states such as Texas the ability to bring the types of immigration lawsuits against the federal government that have been rejected by the courts, including conservative judges, legal experts say. But it would go further, also authorizing state attorneys general to sue to overturn the decisions to release individual immigrants — and even to obtain wide-reaching sanctions on a foreign country for refusing to accept a national eligible for removal. With Democrats eager to show that they were pivoting on an issue that cost them in the 2024 election, the bill has passed the House and easily cleared its first procedural hurdle on the Senate floor, with just nine senators voting against that step Thursday. But giving states new authorities to sue is emerging as a flashpoint for some Democrats, who want changes before a final vote. “I don’t think we want the entire immigration system being litigated in district courts all across the country,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told reporters last week. Republicans will likely need the votes of seven Democrats for final approval; 33 members of the Democratic caucus voted in favor of advancing it to the next procedural step. The bill would give state attorneys general multiple ways to intervene in how the federal government is carrying out immigration law. States would be able to sue when they believe the Department of Homeland Security was not enforcing the full scope of bill’s mandates that certain immigrants be detained. They could also bring federal lawsuits challenging the decisions of DHS or immigration judges to release individual immigrants picked up for alleged crimes in their states. Notably, the new legal powers would only flow one way. States could sue the federal government for deciding to release an undocumented migrant in custody, but it does not authorize state lawsuits for when a person is allegedly being unlawfully detained. And attorneys general also could seek federal court orders forcing the US State Department to stop issuing visas to a country that refused to accept nationals that were eligible for deportation. “It could allow a single district court judge to set off a massive international incident with potentially sweeping ramification for the US economy and for immigration writ large,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, on a recent call with reporters. “There is no reason why Congress should be authorizing state attorneys general to essentially be the people to decide who we sanction as a nation.” Defenders of the measure say the provisions are necessary after President Joe Biden and previous administrations refused to use all the tools given to the executive branch by Congress to crack down on crimes committed by migrants. The legislation is named after Laken Riley, a college student who was raped and killed by an undocumented immigrant who had been previously arrested and released multiple times. Condemnation of her murder — and the Biden immigration policies Republicans claimed caused it — was prominent in Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and those of down-ballot Republicans, too. The attorneys general provisions are the parts of the bill that have “the most force,” said Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican championing the bill. “The bill would lose 90 percent of its luster if that was taken out.” The court provisions have not gotten much attention compared with the parts of the bill that would mandate the detention of migrants charged with certain crimes. Among the new offenses that would make an immigrant eligible for mandatory detention under the bill are nonviolent crimes such as shoplifting and theft. Critics say those mandates will divert resources from arresting and detaining the violent criminals who are in the United States illegally. With the attorneys general provisions, the bill’s architects sought to pair those requirements with new mechanisms that “give the states some way to fight back or challenge a president who is choosing not to enforce the law,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter immigration policies. “The states tried numerous types of lawsuits to get the courts to force the Biden administration to live up to its responsibilities to enforce law, and they didn’t have a great deal of success,” she said. In 2023, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled that Texas and Louisiana did not have standing to challenge the Biden administration’s changes to government deportation priorities. The Biden policy favored deporting immigrants who were national security threats or violent criminals over those accused of less serious offenses. The new bill would seek to overturn that precedent by giving states standing to sue over such shifts in Homeland Security policy. They’d also be allowed to challenge in federal court the decisions of immigration judges, who are under the purview of the US attorney general and Justice Department, to release individual immigrants from detention. But the stakes are especially high for the provisions authorizing state lawsuits to seeking court-ordered visa bans against so-called a “recalcitrant country” that won’t accept an immigrant eligible for deportation in the state. The US is unable to return some nationalities because of frosty relations with certain countries, such as Venezuela. Such a provision would allow Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, for instance, to seek a ban on all visas for skilled workers from China or an end of all business tourism from India, because those countries refuse repatriation of their citizens, according to Reichlin-Melnick. If the bill ultimately becomes law, that provision, and possibly others, will likely be challenged in court. Acknowledging the “legitimate concerns” about the bill’s visa sanctions section, Vaughan said that, at the very least, the court fights could “get some sort of clarification on how the federal government can be nudged into doing its job more effectively.” Murphy, who did not cast a vote when the bill was up for a procedural vote on Thursday, said the attorneys general provisions would “make the immigration system much, much, much more complicated and Byzantine and confusing.” “The underlying bill looks like a not well-constructed piece of legislation, but we could potentially make it better,” he said."
Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/politics/jack-smith-resigns-special-counsel-doj/index.html,"Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department effective Friday, according to a court filing. The filing comes amid a legal fight to stop Attorney General Merrick Garland from releasing the special counsel’s report of his investigations into then-President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the alleged mishandling of classified documents after Trump left office. Smith gave his final, two-volume report to the attorney general on Tuesday. Garland has indicated he would not release the part of the report regarding the classified documents investigation, but believes it should be public eventually. Smith’s office has been in the wind-down process for weeks, and his resignation before Trump takes office isn’t unexpected. In addition to finalizing its report and sending it to the attorney general, Smith’s team had also handed off an ongoing appeal over the special counsel’s office powers to other attorneys at the Department of Justice and dismissed the two federal criminal cases against Trump because of his return to the presidency. The attorney general has also told congressional committee leaders he intends to give to them confidential access to Smith’s volume on the classified documents case — making this weekend and next week a crucial window for AG Merrick Garland’s intentions of transparency. In the meantime, the Justice Department is battling in court with Trump and his former co-defendants over whether Smith’s report can be made public, with the clock ticking down to the the January 20 inauguration. Trump is planning to appoint some members of his defense team, who have argued in court against publication, to high-level positions at the Justice Department. An appeals court on Friday rejected a request from Trump and his allies to keep the report under wraps. The Justice Department has since appealed a temporary hold that Judge Aileen Cannon placed on the report’s release, and the former defendants have asked her to extend that hold, which otherwise expires Sunday evening. As the court fight stands now, the Justice Department may be able to release Smith’s first volume to the public Sunday or Monday. Cannon, however, has asked for more information from the Justice Department by Sunday morning about what’s in Volume 1 and whether any of it bears on the classified documents case. The Justice Department responded to Cannon again Sunday morning, saying nothing in the 2020 election volume of Smith’s report relates to Trump’s co-defendants in the classified documents case, even in a broad sense. They note the volume references the classified documents case twice, but provide little other detail. Cannon will get to see that “relevant text” confidentially, the DOJ said. Smith was appointed by Garland to take over the documents and election subversion investigations in November 2022, after Trump announced his campaign for reelection. A former federal prosecutor, Smith had more recently served as a war crimes prosecutor at the Hague. He brought charges against Trump in both investigations in 2023, but both prosecutions ran into legal setbacks, and with voters’ decision to return Trump to the White House, the president-elect was dismissed from the cases. One legacy from Smith’s investigations is the sweeping presidential immunity ruling handed down by the Supreme Court in the election subversion case, which set a very high bar for prosecuting a former president for his official acts in office. Trump celebrated Smith’s resignation on Truth Social Sunday, calling him “a disgrace to himself, his family, and his Country.” In another post the same day, Trump said, “The Stench of Deranged Jack Smith and his thugs is GONE. … Deranged Jack accomplished nothing, except to show what complete losers my political opponents are!!!” The president-elect and his allies on the Hill have publicly discussed investigations they intend to launch into the special counsel probes. The report potentially acts as Smith’s final word on what his investigations found, and their legal reasoning. The current court fight aside, there are other avenues by which the report might become public. Congress could take steps to obtain the report or information from it. There is also the possibility of Freedom of Information Acts requests, and litigation stemming from those requests, forcing the disclosure of details from the report. Trump’s former co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos DeOliveira, are arguing that the report should not be shared with Congress or the public because it would be prejudicial in the event that the prosecution against them — dismissed by Judge Cannon on the grounds that Smith was unconstitutionally appointed — was revived by an appeals court. The new filing from DOJ countered that argument by pointing to Garland’s decision not to publicly release that report and by noting that the lawmakers that would be allowed to view it, under Garland’s plan, would be prohibited from sharing details from it. Trump and his allies are also arguing that Cannon’s ruling disqualifying Smith deprived him of the power to write the report and prevents Garland from releasing it.

Trump’s Cabinet picks face tests of loyalty during upcoming confirmation hearings,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/politics/trump-cabinet-loyalty-test-confirmation-hearings/index.html,"Senate confirmation hearings set to begin this week are likely to reveal a defining trait uniting Donald Trump’s incoming Cabinet, regardless of their diverse political backgrounds and uneven qualifications: an unflinching allegiance to the president-elect. For weeks, Trump’s handpicked nominees have undergone rigorous preparations for their high-stakes Capitol Hill appearances — including intensive studying sessions, contentious mock hearings and heavy-handed coaching from Republican senators. Over long hours behind closed doors, Trump’s allies and advisers have forced candidates to confront their vulnerabilities, perfect their pitches and practice sidestepping traps laid by Democrats. The intense rehearsals are not all too different from Trump’s first term, when his team prepared its nominees during practices by interrupting their answers with protests, shouting matches between stand-in committee members, personal attacks and other outbursts intended to derail their concentration. What distinguishes this round of confirmations, however, is the heightened expectation that Trump’s picks will present not just their own expertise but a clear and unwavering loyalty to the president-elect’s agenda — a public display of fealty that was not always assured during his first term. “This time, people view the nominees as an extension of Donald Trump and his agenda,” said Sean Spicer, who helped ready Trump’s nominees while serving as his first press secretary. “They’re not there to defend their own views; they’re there to defend Trump’s policies.” “The movement was in a very different place,” Spicer said of the days after Trump’s first election in 2016. Indeed, hearings for Trump’s Cabinet eight years ago were defined in part by the pained efforts by some of his nominees to distance their views from the campaign declarations of the man they intended to serve. Several of them, for example, told senators they viewed climate change as a legitimate man-made threat, while Trump as a candidate in 2016 called it a “Chinese hoax.” Others appeared unpersuaded by Trump’s plans to build a wall at the US-Mexico border to halt illegal immigration. The leading diplomatic voices in that first administration, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, as nominees expressed concerns about Trump’s dismissive posture toward Russia’s provocations while promising to uphold the alliances Trump often sought to undermine. Meanwhile, the nominee to lead the Pentagon, James Mattis, vowed to sustain the Iran nuclear agreement that Trump decried as a bad deal all throughout the campaign. The remarkable disconnect set the tone for a tenuous relationship at times between Trump and his Cabinet, which included people he was barely acquainted with before he elevated them to top posts. The dynamic often left him distrusting of the people around him and at times sent him spiraling over a perceived lack of loyalty. Trump has since gone on to describe some of his early personnel selections as “the biggest mistake I made.” “I picked some great people, you know, but you don’t think about that. I picked some people that I shouldn’t have picked,” he told podcaster and comedian Joe Rogan during the 2024 campaign, disparaging some of his choices as “bad people or disloyal people.” The evolution of the GOP and its approach to Trump’s plans is illustrated by his latest pick for secretary of state, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Eight years ago, coming off his unsuccessful primary race against Trump, Rubio used his position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to push Tillerson toward the Florida Republican’s own hawkish views and away from the incoming president’s isolationist rhetoric. During one contentious exchange, Rubio pressed Tillerson to call Russian President Vladamir Putin a war criminal. Tillerson declined to do so, and Rubio initially wouldn’t commit to supporting Trump’s secretary of state, though he eventually did. Now on the cusp of his own Senate confirmation hearing to serve as Trump’s top diplomat, Rubio has aligned himself closely with Trump’s worldview. “The job of the secretary of state is to execute on the foreign policy set by the elected president of the United States,” Rubio said shortly after Trump tapped him for the role. “I hope to have the opportunity to do it if my current colleagues in the US Senate confirm me.” As it is, Republicans believe Trump is on track to have his Cabinet approved at a much faster clip than in 2017, when delays in turning over ethics agreements, FBI background checks and other concerns dragged the proceedings beyond the initial weeks of Trump’s new administration. There is still the potential for holdups. Many Trump Cabinet picks — who include some of the country’s wealthiest people — haven’t disclosed their finances or their plans for untangling their fortunes from their new assignments in government. Other snags could materialize along the way. Hearings will kick off on Tuesday, beginning with former Georgia Rep. Douglas Collins, the pick for secretary of Veterans Affairs, who will appear before the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, Trump’s choice for secretary of Defense. “The American people are going to like what they see from these brilliant people over the next few weeks,” Trump’s incoming press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told CNN of Trump’s picks. Still, challenges remain for some of Trump’s more controversial and unconventional choices to lead his government, including Hegseth; former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services; and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence. And already one of Trump’s choices — former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general — was forced to pull out of the running after it became clear some Republicans were unwilling to overlook troubling accusations of sexual and personal misconduct that Gaetz has denied. For now, Trump is standing by his remaining picks, and several Republican senators have been taking a hands-on approach to helping them navigate the process — especially contentious selections who may have less experience in a high-profile confirmation hearing setting. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma, has participated in practice hearings that he said last for more than two hours and “don’t pull any punches.” “We have a chair, we have the ranking member. We have name tags out there. We have the mics,” Mullin said. The sessions have included practices with Hegseth, who enters the hearing amid mounting turmoil from his past, including allegations of sexual assault, workplace drinking and mismanaging a veterans charity. The Army veteran has denied wrongdoing. “He’s not the only one. We are doing it with all the nominees. Just so they understand the way it works so they aren’t surprised,” Mullin said. Several Trump allies and veterans of confirmation battles cautioned that the president-elect’s support for people like Hegseth could change abruptly if they don’t deliver a convincing performance during their confirmation hearings. “The bigger challenge for any of the (nominees) is just making sure the president still has confidence in them when they’ve completed their discussions,” said South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds. Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, who has counseled Trump through tough nomination fights in the past, said he believes the incoming president and his Senate allies are sticking by Hegseth in part because of what they learned from past confirmation fireworks. Many Republicans remain hardened by the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced accusations of sexual assault soon after his appointment that he vehemently denied. In 2017, Trump’s nominee for secretary of labor, businessman Andrew Puzder, withdrew after a report resurfaced past allegations of domestic abuse, which were later withdrawn, that an ex-wife made on Oprah. (Puzder had denied the abuse.) Reed didn’t dismiss the allegations against Hegseth, but suggested politics may be at play. “These charges should be taken seriously, but on the other hand, at this point, I approach it with a higher standard of evidence because this is the Democratic playbook,” he said. Pressed on how nominees can begin to prepare for the tension that is a hallmark of the modern day confirmation hearing, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a veteran of Senate Judiciary Committee, said: “Go back and watch videos of the Kavanagh hearing.” Republicans are also working behind the scenes to help shore up GOP support for the picks who may face some headwinds in a floor vote. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN he has been encouraging GOP senators on the fence to meet with FBI director pick Kash Patel. Tillis has urged Patel to get out in front of some of his past contentious statements early in his public confirmation hearing and explain himself succinctly. “He clearly needs to address some of the things that have been amplified from some of his writings and in his book, but I actually think he’s been unfairly treated and the hearing is going to give him an opportunity to address those concerns,” Tillis said. Senators have stressed to the Cabinet selections the gravity of their hearings, cautioning that these events can make or break their chances. Tillis has also warned Trump’s transition team not to shelter potential Cabinet officials behind closed doors and leave them unprepared for difficult questions. Surprises on the day of the hearing can be just as problematic for a candidate, he has told them. “We gotta get these folks ready to get on the field,” Tillis said. Others have pushed the nominees to remember a simple rule: Humility can go a long way in a high-drama confirmation process, especially in a televised hearing. “I think where you get into trouble is when you say, ‘I don’t want to talk about this, I don’t want to talk about that.’ It’s better to just say, ‘Here’s the deal,”” Sen. Josh Hawley said. The Missouri Republican said he had one such interaction in a private meeting with Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic. During the encounter, Hawley pushed Kennedy on a separate area of concern for some Republicans: his past support for increasing abortion access. “I asked him a bunch of pointed questions on life policy. He was very candid with them and I appreciated his candor. I just think that gets you points,” Hawley said. Knowing when you don’t know the answer is another key part of preparation, senators warn. Sen. Deb Fischer, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, told CNN that when she met with Hegseth the first time she had a good meeting, but there were some areas that were priorities for her that Hegseth wasn’t “up on.” He left the meeting but then days later called back to schedule another so he could be more prepared to discuss her priorities. “He came back so we could talk more in depth. I give him a lot of credit for doing that,” the Nebraska Republican said. What remains to be seen is whether any lingering concerns from Senate Republicans materialize in the form of tough questions when the nominees are under oath. While most Republicans supported Trump’s picks eight years ago, there were some tense moments during confirmation hearings. In addition to Rubio’s grilling of Tillerson, then-Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada turned the screws on Trump’s pick to lead the Treasury Department, Steve Mnuchin, over foreclosures in his state at the hands of Mnuchin’s bank. Trump’s allies have pressured Senate Republicans to fall in line, with some threatening primary challenges to those who stand in the way of the incoming president. Vice President-elect JD Vance sought to remind the GOP who leads the party, arguing on social media that Trump’s “coattails turned a 49-51 senate to a 53-47 senate.” “He deserves a cabinet that is loyal to the agenda he was elected to implement,” Vance said."
"Fiscal hawks draw red lines on Trump’s first big bill, risking GOP support",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/politics/house-republican-conservatives-trump-agenda/index.html,"Rep. Tim Burchett has never voted to increase the US borrowing limit in his life. And that might not change just because Donald Trump is the one to ask for his vote. “I don’t know that I ever will,” Burchett told CNN when asked if he could support Trump’s plans for a debt limit hike. Burchett, along with several other GOP hardliners, are drawing a clear red line when it comes to Trump’s first big policy package. They say the measure — which is expected to include a raise in the nation’s debt limit in addition to billions of dollars in spending on border security, energy projects and tax extensions — must be fully paid for, and not with accounting gimmicks that even Republicans have used in the past. “You have to show me some reductions in spending. Some real reductions in spending. Not this stuff, ‘Oh we’re going to do this.’” Burchett said, dismissing past GOP attempts at budget reform that ultimately fizzle out. Burchett is among multiple House and Senate conservatives who told CNN they are demanding hundreds of billions — or even trillions — in spending cuts in order to support Trump’s plan. Yet if they get their wish, it’s bound to cause a revolt among other quarters in the GOP, namely among Republican moderates and appropriators who have long protected certain cherished domestic programs. And that could cause the whole effort to collapse. “The more things we pile onto a reconciliation package the bigger the invitation for opposition,” said Rep. Steve Womack, a senior appropriator and Republican of Arkansas. “And I am concerned about that.” It all underscores the enormous challenge Trump faces in piecing together a coalition behind what he calls “one beautiful bill” — as party leaders navigate internal divisions over a complex suite of policies that House Speaker Mike Johnson has vowed to bring to the floor by April even though he’ll need near unanimous support within his conference to win passage. The chairman of the House Budget Committee is now preparing a list of $5 trillion worth of potential spending cuts in order to win over his conference, according to sources involved in the effort. Yet Republicans say the fiscal fights are bound to be among the hardest to resolve. “I’ve never voted for a debt ceiling increase before, and I would like to make sure that we’re paying for that,” said Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican and member of the House Freedom Caucus. Rep. Eli Crane, a Republican of Arizona, said he “most likely” would have major demands in exchange for including the debt limit. Asked how he felt about Trump’s push to raise the national borrowing limit as part of the plan, Crane said: “I’ve got no comment.” While no member is rejecting Trump’s agenda outright, they are signaling they are willing to dig in against any bill that doesn’t include steep — and immediate — cuts to pay for the entirety of the plan, plus paying down some of the national debt. If the government funding fight from December, where 38 Republicans voted against the bill that included the debt hike Trump wanted, is any indication, Trump merely calling on lawmakers to support it again might not be enough. The president-elect, for instance, personally influenced Johnson’s last attempt to raise the debt limit. And that sentiment hasn’t changed among many conservatives. “Bad idea,” Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, told CNN when asked about including a debt-limit hike in the broader package. Yet the borrowing limit will need to be raised sometime this year to avoid the first-ever debt default, a potential economic calamity Trump is so eager to avoid that he made a last-ditch push to raise it in December that nearly spurred a government shutdown ahead of Christmas. Johnson was ultimately forced to punt on the debt limit and now plans to include the plan in the massive Trump bill. Since they are using a budget process that can’t be filibustered under the rules in the Senate, Johnson argues that they can raise the debt limit on their own terms – meaning they won’t need Democratic buy-in to pass the bill. But that means they’ll need to keep their own party in line. Senior Republicans see the early warnings from the right as an ominous sign for a massive bill that must win support from all but a single Republican in the House. And some privately believe it may be impossible to pass any debt limit hike without help from Democrats. Asked about fellow Republican gripes over the debt limit, senior Rep. Frank Lucas of Oklahoma said there are members who “never will” support it. “That’s occasionally been a problem here — matching idealism with reality,” Lucas said. “And many of my friends who have never voted for a debt limit issue have voted for every increase in defense spending, every increase in infrastructure.” Trump and GOP leaders are working aggressively to win over these conservatives on the early stages of the bill. The president-elect hosted members of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus at Mar-a-Lago this weekend. But some conservatives say they aren’t entirely satisfied with what they’re hearing so far. Rep. Keith Self, a Republican from Texas who initially opposed Johnson as speaker on January 3, told CNN he is concerned that “spending was not well addressed” in a recent policy session with House GOP leaders. “Reconciliation is about controlling spending on the mandatory side,” Self said, referring to the budget process used to circumvent the filibuster. “We need to make sure we’re doing that.” The budgetary math, though, is difficult as Johnson and others have ruled out any cuts to costly programs like Medicare and Social Security. “Look, the president(-elect) has made it very clear. Social Security and Medicare have to be preserved and we are not, no one is coming in with the intention of cutting benefits in any way or anything,” Johnson told reporters. Instead, Republicans are discussing ways to trim spending from programs like Medicaid or nutritional programs by instituting work requirements. There are easy GOP targets, like recouping the costs of Biden’s attempt to forgive student loan debt or his new federal support for electric vehicles, which Republicans believe could save at least $100 billion. But that’s unlikely to cover the whole price tag. One GOP aide described it as taking a “scalpel into a mine to look for ore.” And any decision to slash spending risks losing more GOP voters. “We’ve got 20 or 25 different complex issues,” said Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, a stalwart fiscal hawk. His biggest single priority is making sure the bill doesn’t cost more money — real savings and “not bull crap, made up” cuts. Asked if he would buckle to pressure from Trump to raise the debt limit, Roy told CNN: “I fully support clearing the decks on the debt ceiling … But I’m not going to back off my belief that we need to drive deficits down.” Most members heading down to Mar-a-Lago say they will be in listening mode, hoping that Trump will present them with ideas they can get behind. “It’s having those lines of communication, which I think are really important,” GOP Rep. Byron Donalds, who met with Trump on Friday night, told CNN. Conservatives in Congress say they will insist that the full package — including any extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts — are fully paid for, unlike the first time around. “Republicans want to return to fiscal responsibility that has been lost over the last several years under leadership from both parties,” said Rep. Ben Cline, a member of the Freedom Caucus and GOP budget committee. But that dynamic gets trickier as GOP leaders consider adding even more tax breaks. Johnson is under intense pressure by a small group of New York Republicans to restore a costly state and local tax benefit that their party restricted in 2017. Cline said bringing back the more generous deduction, known as SALT, could cost as much as a trillion dollars. “Are those savings achievable? Is this conference willing to seek them out and include them? That is something we have to talk about,” Cline said, when asked about the tax deductions. But that group of Republicans, representing swing districts in New York, New Jersey and California, will also meet with Trump this weekend as some of those members say restoring the SALT tax break is their own red line. “Look, I’ve been very clear,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago this weekend. “I will not support a tax bill that does not lift the cap on SALT.” Rep. Ralph Norman, another Freedom Caucus member, believes Trump will ultimately help keep the GOP in line behind his bill. He pointed to a phone call from Trump last week during the speaker election, when Trump helped convince him to give Johnson a full term as speaker. “He will call 100 people if it takes that, just like he did with me. I want a president, who can tell us directly, ‘This is why I need it, and, what’s it going to take to get you on board?’” Norman said."
Democrats search for a leader to rebuild as the party figures out what comes next,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/politics/democrats-chair-forums/index.html,"As Democrats head toward an uncertain future under a second Trump administration, the party’s search for a new leader to help rebuild the party also remains unsettled. The process of choosing a new Democratic National Committee chair kicked off Saturday, when eight candidates met virtually in the first party-run forum of the race. With three weeks to go before the February 1 election, no candidate has locked up support from a majority of the 448 party insiders who’ll choose the next party leader. The chair race marks the first major decision Democrats will make after facing disastrous losses in last year’s general election. The contest to lead the party, and the various unofficial forums and small group meetings that preceded Saturday’s event, have become a space for Democrats to hash out what went wrong, how to reach the voters who abandoned the party in November and how the millions of dollars spent in lost swing states might have been better used. Despite early reports that some high-profile names were considering joining the race, the current field of eight candidates – led by Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party chair Ken Martin, Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley – is made up of figures who are not well known nationally. For many DNC members, that’s a bonus. “The vibe I get is that people are super hungry for an operative chair,” said one DNC member who is part of a state delegation. “We want workhorses.” The DNC is made up of a mix of state party leaders and committee people, members of allied Democratic groups, union leaders and at-large members appointed by the current chair. The largest bloc consists of the state party leaders, who have made investments in their states a key issue. Solidifying support from state party chairs and vice chairs, who make up about 114 members of the DNC and have influence over their state delegations, could prove key to winning a race where no candidate has locked up a majority of support. The DNC will hold three additional forums: one in Detroit on January 16 focused on the Midwest; one virtually on January 23 focused on the West; and a final in-person event in Washington, DC, on January 30, focused on the East. Saturday’s forum focused on the issues of the South. Christale Spain, the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party who is still deciding who she’ll back in the February 1 election, said she wanted to know the candidates’ plans for funding a “Southern strategy.” “We just cannot concede ground because it’s hard,” Spain said ahead of the forum. “We can win in the South, but it’s just going to take a long-term investment.” During the debate, the candidates discussed their plans to invest in Southern states through recruitment, messaging and more funding for state parties. “When I say we have to focus on a 10-year strategy which rejects Southern political disinvestment, it’s not a platitude — it’s mission-critical,” Martin said. Many DNC members are hoping now is the time to shake up not just how funds are distributed but how the party operates broadly. The last time Democrats were able to elect a DNC chair – in 2017, after Donald Trump first won the White House – the party instituted major reforms to address the concerns of progressives who backed independent Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign. This time around, candidates are being pressed on messaging to working class voters, holding consultants accountable and investing in state parties frustrated by the disparity between the amount of money that went into battleground states and what could have been spent to make their races more competitive. It’s difficult to say how much support any candidate has. The DNC doesn’t publicly release its member lists, and no campaigns have released full lists of their endorsements. According to the campaigns of the leading candidates, Martin has “well over 100” endorsements; O’Malley has “60+ and counting”; New York state Sen. James Skoufis has 23 endorsements; and Wikler has declined to release numbers. In addition to Martin, Wikler, O’Malley and Skoufis, four other candidates have gathered enough signatures to appear at the Saturday forum: former congressional candidate Quintessa Hathaway; attorney and political strategist Jason Paul; Nate Snyder, a former US Department of Homeland Security official; and former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson. Martin – who has been a state party chair since 2011 and now chairs the Association of State Democratic Committees – has the deepest ties to state party leaders. In interviews, chairs who’ve endorsed him said he’s been a constant presence over the years, providing insight, aiding with fundraising and traveling through their states with them. Earlier this month, Martin campaigned in northern Virginia on behalf of candidates running in special elections for an open state House and Senate seat. Susan Swecker, the chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said he also visited Virginia in the fall to campaign for congressional candidates and in 2021 when Democrats lost the governorship. “One of the things I love about Ken is he shows up and is ready to do the hard work,” Swecker said. Russ Carnahan, a former US representative who now leads the Missouri Democratic Party, said Martin had been instrumental in helping the party rebuild when Carnahan took over in 2023. As the race unfolded, Carnahan suggested to his state’s delegation that they vote as a bloc. “About three minutes into the meeting, everybody was like, ‘Well, this is a no brainer: Ken,’” he said. “We know what he’s done in his own state, we know what he’s done nationally, and we know what he’s done very substantially to help us in Missouri.” A spokesperson for Wikler pointed to his work with his colleagues. In 2021, the Wisconsin Democratic Party donated $300,000 to the Florida Democratic Party to help them pay for staff health insurance. Wikler also advised entrepreneur and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman to send funds to the Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina and Ohio state parties, according to the spokesperson. Allies of Martin have portrayed Wikler as too closely tied to donors at a time when Democrats are questioning the party’s ties to the consultant class. But the Wisconsin Democrat’s supporters note that whoever leads the party must be able to fundraise – an area where Wikler has excelled. In 2024, his state party raised nearly $62 million, more than any other state party committee. Lavora Barnes, the outgoing chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, said she was endorsing Wikler because of the work he’d done building up the state party in Wisconsin. “It’s been helpful to me to have Ben to call to bounce ideas off of, to share thoughts, to occasionally commiserate with – and Ben has done the same with me,” she said. “We have been truly able to help each other through some tough moments during these campaigns.” As the race heads into its final weeks, Barnes argued that DNC members are still weighing their options. “I think that everyone who is watching this should consider it an open race, that there are still votes to be gotten, and that Ben is going to do all he can to get each and every one of those votes,” she said. No candidate has claimed as many private endorsements or released as many public ones as Martin – including endorsements from eight state delegations and the party chairs of seven additional states. But other campaigns say the Minnesotan also failed to secure enough votes to lock up the office and expect that no candidate will win a majority of ballots during the first round of voting. “No one’s been able to run away with it over the past two months,” Skoufis said. Others have pointed to the news that the Association of State Democratic Committees, the group Martin chairs that represents the largest voting bloc in the DNC, decided this week not to endorse a candidate. Those arguing the race is still fluid have also pointed to the news this week that the ASDC, the group of which Wikler is a member, decided not to endorse. While Martin’s supporters said state party leaders felt choosing would not be conducive to party unity, backers of other campaigns said it was a sign there are votes to be won among the ASDC’s ranks. “That says that they are still open, and they’re still looking,” former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, an O’Malley supporter who cannot vote in the DNC election, told CNN. “I think that there is an opportunity, clearly, for someone to make their case.” Another DNC member, who said they are considering Martin and Wikler while “keeping an open mind” about O’Malley, said their colleagues were “underwhelmed” by the field. “I do think a lot of folks who are keeping their powder dry are still waiting to see if somebody else jumps in,” they said. “If there is somebody else with any sort of stature who is compelling or inspiring it shouldn’t be that hard for them to make the ballot.” This story has been updated with new reporting."
Trump border czar privately tempers Republican lawmaker expectations on administration’s initial deportation operation,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/politics/trump-border-czar-tom-homan-deportations/index.html,"President-elect Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan has privately told Republican lawmakers to temper their expectations for the incoming administration’s initial deportation operation, citing limited resources, according to multiple sources involved in the conversations. While Trump’s allies have floated measures to detain and deport people residing in the US illegally, the plans largely depend on the resources and funds available to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which historically has had budget shortfalls. “We are not having a discussion about 20 million (deportations). We are having a discussion about an order, and priority, and expectation,” GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, who was in one of the meetings with Homan, told CNN. The discussions are part of a broader level-setting that is occurring among House Republicans, who are now coming to terms with the challenges of turning one of their key campaign promises into a reality. Republicans are also grappling with the harsh realization that most of their border overhaul measures are unlikely to be included in Trump’s massive agenda bill, given the strict rules around the reconciliation process that require proposals to either increase revenue or reduce spending, not change policy. “Many members are only now beginning to understand that,” one GOP lawmaker told CNN. Trump has vowed to launch the largest deportation operation in history, telling Time Magazine in December he believes there will be “probably 15 and maybe as many as 20 million” undocumented immigrants in the US by the time he takes office. In recent meetings with House Republicans, Homan, a veteran of immigration enforcement, has outlined a tiered approach to Trump’s mass deportation pledge, according to lawmakers and sources involved in the discussions. Homan and lawmakers are using current government funding levels to craft a plan that targets between 1 and 2 million undocumented immigrants who are eligible for removal as quickly as possible, according to multiple sources in the discussions. There are currently about 1.4 million people in the US with final immigration orders of removal. “Homan has been telling some of the members that ‘Hey, if you want me to do all these things that you’re talking about, this costs money, and it’s not being done with the CR that’s in place now,” one GOP lawmaker told CNN, referring to the continuing budget resolution that simply extends the current level of DHS funding. “President Trump will enlist every federal power and coordinate with state authorities to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers in American history while simultaneously lowering costs for families. The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, like deporting migrant criminals and restoring our economic greatness. He will deliver,” Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump-Vance transition team told CNN in a statement. Another GOP lawmaker whose committee oversees the Department of Homeland Security budget told CNN that Homan is trying to work as fast as the confines of the system allow. “His message is not code talk for, ‘Nothing is going to happen’ or, ‘We’re going to slow down’ or whatever. But it is a responsible policy approach to getting stuff done quickly, but also in the context of realistic evaluation of how to best get that done and fulfill the promises that the incoming administration has made,” GOP Rep. Mark Amodei told CNN. Homan has repeatedly stressed that he remains focused on public safety and national security threats, but hasn’t ruled out that others who are in the US illegally but do not pose a safety threat could be swept up in deportations. In an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Homan said he would need a minimum of 100,000 beds to detain undocumented immigrants — more than doubling the 40,000 detention beds ICE is currently funded for — and would require more ICE agents. The agency has around 6,000 immigration enforcement officers. “It all depends on the funding I get from the Hill,” Homan said on CNN’s “The Source.” He wouldn’t specify how many undocumented immigrants he hopes to see deported by the end of Trump’s next four years in office. Some Republicans told CNN they have gotten the funding message. “He’s going to need money right away,” GOP Rep. Andy Biggs told CNN. But many lawmakers are acknowledging that getting Homan the funding he would need to undertake an unprecedented deportation effort would be extremely challenging. Republicans are trying to massively cut government spending across the board, yet all parties involved acknowledge that increasing deportations will cost significantly more than what the government has currently allocated. According to an initial estimate by the American Immigration Council, deporting 1 million people per year would cost approximately $88 billion annually and $960 billion over a 10-year period. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported 271,484 immigrants last fiscal year under President Joe Biden, marking the highest level of deportations since 2014, according to an annual report. Former President Barack Obama deported around 400,000 in one year, but a large number of those were people who had only recently crossed the border. Trump faces a steeper challenge in targeting those already in the country. Yet with the next government funding deadline two months away, top House appropriators tell CNN they haven’t even been given top-line numbers to begin working with, making their ability to plan how to scale up funding for deportations that much more challenging. “While there may be some private discussions going on, nobody is talking publicly right now about March 14. And it’s going to get here pretty soon. We’re right at two months away. We need to fund this government,” GOP Rep. Steve Womack, a senior House GOP appropriator, told CNN. “It will be unacceptable for us to blame our inaction that we just ran out of time.” “It will cost a lot to deport,” Biggs told CNN. “But guess what? It will also save a lot. And it’ll be a net benefit.” But despite all of the pitfalls ahead, Republicans know they have to start somewhere, and argue that once the deportations under Trump start, there is a serious likelihood that undocumented immigrants will self-deport. There is also an acknowledgment that Trump’s expected executive orders will do a lot to get the process of addressing deportations, closing down the border and overhauling the immigration system started. Republicans also say there is a serious need to address staffing at ICE and secure enough detention beds. Groups of Republicans are scheduled to be at Mar-a-Lago this weekend to meet with Trump directly and are looking for direction and an honest conversation about what’s next. GOP Rep. Clay Higgins, part of one of the groups expected to meet with Trump this weekend, said while Trump may see the challenges ahead, it’s not stopping him from aiming high. “He says, ‘I understand the complications. Work through them. Make it happen. I want it done yesterday,’” Higgins said of Trump’s mindset."
"More than a dozen states have passed new laws that led to restrictions on pornography. Now, the Supreme Court will weigh in",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/politics/invs-porn-age-verification-laws-supreme-court/index.html,"In Texas, Florida, and more than a dozen other states, users who try to access the world’s largest pornography website are greeted by a surprising sight: a message on a black screen telling them they’re blocked because of the actions of their state legislature. Over the last two and a half years, 19 states – home to more than a third of Americans – have passed laws that require pornography websites to confirm a user’s age by checking a government-issued ID or scanning their face, among other methods. The new laws, which have been pushed by allies of President-elect Donald Trump, have led some of the largest adult sites, including Pornhub, to block users from specific states, rather than paying millions for ID-checking services. Next week, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge to the constitutionality of the new laws, setting up a battle over free speech, censorship and how to protect kids online. The case could end up eroding landmark precedents protecting pornography, following previous decisions from the court that have overturned decades-old case law. To supporters, the restrictions in the age verification laws are common-sense measures to prevent children from seeing explicit content. But critics say the push to restrict porn undermines free speech protections and infringes on privacy rights. It could also put some porn companies out of business because of the high costs of verifying the age of every visitor, while doing little to stop foreign or fringe porn websites that don’t comply with US laws. “Porn is the canary in the coalmine of free speech,” said Mike Stabile, a spokesperson for the Free Speech Coalition, a trade association for the adult entertainment industry that is among the plaintiffs of the lawsuit against Texas. “These bills are meant to put the adult industry out of practice.” For decades, users visiting online porn sites have been met with a popup asking a question that’s as easy to fake as it is ubiquitous: Are you 18 or older? Texas’ law, like others passed around the country, says that’s no longer enough. It requires websites on which more than a third of the content is “sexual material harmful to minors” to actually verify each user’s age, such as by having them upload a state ID or through AI-powered software that estimates a person’s age based on a photo of their face. Some states’ laws also mandate porn websites display “health warnings,” such as the Alabama requirement that sites tell their users porn is “proven to harm human brain development” and   “increases the demand for prostitution, child exploitation, and child pornography.” And Kansas’ law includes in its definition of pornography any act of “homosexuality.” The explosion of new laws in recent years has been pushed by groups associated with Project 2025, a controversial conservative policy blueprint written in anticipation of  Trump’s second term. Project 2025’s more than 900-page policy memo declares that “pornography should be outlawed,” argues that “the people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned” and says companies that “facilitate its spread should be shuttered.” In a hidden-camera video released last year by a British journalism nonprofit, one of the document’s co-authors, former Trump administration official Russell Vought, discussed the legislative strategy for banning pornography. Vought, who is set to return to government in Trump’s second term, says in the video that “we’d have a national ban on pornography if we could.” But instead of such a drastic action, which would likely be unpopular and unconstitutional, he suggested using laws aimed at restricting porn for minors as a way to target the adult industry. “We’ve got a number of states that are passing this and, you know, what happens is the porn company then says, ‘we’re not going to do business in your state,’ which of course is entirely what we were after, right?” Vought said. “We’re doing it from the back door, starting with the kids.” A spokesperson for Vought did not respond to a request for comment this week. The new laws passed across the country appear to be putting the same strategy into action. The two main groups that have lobbied in favor of anti-porn laws at the state level, according to legal observers – Vought’s organization, the Center for Renewing America, and the faith-based group American Principles Project – are both on the advisory board of Project 2025. Proponents of the laws say they’re simply taking advantage of new technologies that make online age verification more feasible than it was in the past – essentially putting the same practices that would take place at any brick-and-mortar adult store into effect online. Texas’ law “protects the innocence of childhood and helps prevent the destructive behavior resulting in porn addiction,” State Rep. Matt Shaheen, the law’s author, wrote in an op-ed last year. He noted that the law does not allow ID verifiers to retain personal information about users, and argued that “for decades, laws restricting similar content found in books and magazines have been upheld.” But opponents say they still have privacy concerns about users uploading their ID’s or scanning their faces. And the new methods have led to a business hit: After Louisiana became the first state to pass an age verification law, Pornhub implemented an ID-checking system for Louisianans, and then saw its traffic there fall by about 80 percent, according to the company. Online ID-checking services can also charge $1 or more per user, costing the sites exorbitant amounts, said Solomon Friedman, the co-founder of the private equity firm that owns Pornhub. Just as Vought predicted, Pornhub has decided not to operate in other states that passed similar laws, instead redirecting users from those states to a message urging them to “contact your representatives” about the restrictions. The rise of age verification laws is “not about keeping young people safe, it is about controlling what adults can experience as legal and consensual,” Friedman said in an interview. “They want to abolish the existence of the adult industry.” Now, the Supreme Court is set to decide whether the new laws are constitutional or not. The justices will hear a challenge to Texas’ age verification law on Wednesday, and their decision will likely determine the fate of similar laws around the country. The case, which was brought by the adult industry trade association and several porn websites and producers, is likely to hinge on the precedent set in the landmark 1997 case Reno v. ACLU. In that case, the court held that the government can’t protect minors through “an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults” when “less restrictive alternatives” are available. Under the court’s precedents, laws that restrict broad areas of speech must stand up to “strict scrutiny,” a higher level of skepticism from courts. A federal judge struck down the Texas age verification law based on that standard in 2023, writing that it would “allow the government to peer into the most intimate and personal aspects of people’s lives.” But the Fifth Circuit appeals court decided to review the Texas law using a lower standard, and ruled that it was constitutional because Texas had a “rational basis” for wanting to protect minors from viewing pornography. One of the main issues up for debate among the Supreme Court justices will be which standard to use. Geoffrey R. Stone, a University of Chicago law professor and First Amendment expert, said the case was just the latest in a half-century of Supreme Court cases dealing with the constitutional ramifications of protecting kids from explicit material. “Under existing law, you can protect children from access to what’s obscene,” Stone said. “The key question is to what extent you can do that in a way that interferes with the access of adults to this material which is constitutionally protected for them.” The Texas law would “probably not be constitutional under existing precedent,” he said, but added that given the court’s conservative majority, the justices could decide to “change that precedent.” The court’s decision isn’t likely to be released until this summer, and the justices have allowed the Texas law to continue in effect while the case proceeds (although a provision that requires porn sites to post a health warning has been blocked). The outcome will likely decide a host of other lawsuits against other states’ laws. One of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Louisiana’s age verification law is Elizabeth Henson, who said she sometimes views the same pornographic videos as her husband as a way of staying intimate together when he’s deployed away from her as part of his service in the Coast Guard. After the couple moved to Louisiana when he was assigned to a new base, Henson tried to sign onto a pornography website, and found it asked for a state ID to verify her age. But her out-of-state ID wasn’t accepted, essentially blocking her from using the site, she said. Henson, who’s also a Coast Guard veteran herself, told CNN she wanted to join the lawsuit as a plaintiff to help give voice to other military families who don’t have a choice where they’re deployed. “It’s not anybody’s business what’s happening in my bedroom, or anybody else’s bedroom,” Henson said. “That’s kind of where it came down for me.” The decision by sites like Pornhub to pull out of some states has led more and more Americans to download the same kind of technology that people in authoritarian countries use to get around their governments’ draconian online censorship regimes. In states where Pornhub has blocked users, there’s been an apparent spike in interest in virtual private networks, tools that can trick websites into thinking the user is in a different location. In Florida and South Carolina, where age-verification laws went into effect on January 1, Google searches for “VPN” more than doubled between the last days of 2024 and the first days of 2025, data from Google Trends shows. Other states followed a similar trend when their laws took effect. At the same time, some other pornography websites that are run outside the US are simply ignoring the new age verification laws – and it’s unclear whether states will be able to force them into compliance.   That means that more users will just be going to sites with fewer safety measures and content moderations in place than the Canada-based Pornhub, Friedman argued. Pornhub and other pornography providers say they want to help protect minors, and don’t want kids coming to their websites at all. They’d like to see different methods to prevent that that don’t put a burden on adults, such as parental controls on phones and computers, or the possibility of age verification systems built into operating systems. If the Supreme Court upholds the age verification laws, some conservative activists may push for a national law in the same mold. Trump hasn’t said anything about whether he supports the idea, and his presidential transition team did not respond to a request for comment. During his first run for president in 2016, Trump did sign a pledge from a conservative group agreeing to “give serious consideration to appointing a Presidential Commission to examine the harmful public health impact of Internet pornography,” although he did not appoint such a commission. Opponents of the age verification laws say that even though access to pornography doesn’t rise to the same civil rights issue as bans on abortion or efforts to restrict LGBTQ rights, they’re coming from the same conservative Christian playbook that’s scored notable wins in recent years. Holly Randall, a pornography producer and photographer, helped pay for political ads raising awareness of the anti-porn statements in Project 2025 during last year’s presidential campaign. Randall’s mother was one of the first female pornographic film directors, working in the industry at a time when it operated in a legal gray area. Now, Randall said, she’s realizing that the First Amendment precedents that her mother’s generation fought for may no longer be secure. “Roe v. Wade being overturned, I think, was a real wake up call for a lot of us,” she said. “That was a sign that we can’t just rest on our laurels and assume porn is going to be fine, they’re never going to outlaw it.” CNN’s Steve Contorno contributed reporting."
"Fact check: As wildfires rage, Trump lashes out with false claims about FEMA and California water policy",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/politics/fact-check-trump-california-wildfires-fema/index.html,"Another natural disaster, another series of false claims from President-elect Donald Trump. For years, Trump has littered his statements on California wildfires and other disasters with inaccurate assertions. He did it again on Wednesday as wildfires raged in Los Angeles County. Here is a fact check. Trump claimed on social media Wednesday that President Joe Biden is leaving him “NO MONEY IN FEMA.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Though FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund was depleted last year by a series of major disasters, Biden signed a bill in December that replenished the fund. “The current balance of the Disaster Relief Fund is approximately $27 billion,” FEMA told CNN in an email on Wednesday. That sum may well prove inadequate to meet the needs created by every disaster that ends up happening this year, but it’s not “no money.” The December bill approved $29 billion in new money for the Disaster Relief Fund – Biden had asked Congress for $40 billion – plus billions more in other new disaster-related funding. “Thanks to Congress’s recent passage of a disaster supplemental, FEMA has the funding and resources needed to respond to the needs of California,” the agency said in the Wednesday email. Trump made similar false claims about FEMA being out of money in the wake of Hurricane Helene in the fall. Trump blamed Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom for the wildfire crisis – claiming in a social media post that Newsom “refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way.” Facts First: This is false. Newsom has never refused to sign a “water restoration declaration.” In fact, there is no such document, as Newsom’s office said on social media on Wednesday and experts on California water policy confirmed. “There was no ‘water restoration declaration’ for him to sign,” Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow in the Water Policy Center at the Public Policy Institute of California think tank, said in a Wednesday interview. “There was never a ‘water restoration declaration’ in California that the Governor refused to sign,” Brent Haddad, an environmental studies professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said in a Wednesday email. In 2020, Newsom did mount a legal challenge to a Trump plan to deliver more water from Northern California to farmers in the state’s Central Valley agricultural hub, saying he was seeking “to protect highly imperiled fish species close to extinction” in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in the north. Trump’s presidential transition team said Thursday that this is what Trump was referring to. But contrary to Trump’s assertion, this federal initiative was not a declaration for Newsom to “sign” or not – and critically, as we’ll explain in the fact-check item below, experts say there is no connection between this long-running policy battle and the current fires. In the same social media post, Trump continued that Newsom refused to sign the supposed declaration because the governor “wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt, by giving it less water (it didn’t work!), but didn’t care about the people of California.” Trump continued: “Now the ultimate price is being paid. I will demand that this incompetent governor allow beautiful, clean, fresh water to FLOW INTO CALIFORNIA! He is the blame for this. On top of it all, no water for fire hydrants, not firefighting planes.” Facts First: These Trump claims include exaggerations, inaccuracies and an overarching false narrative. Most notably, experts on California water policy said Wednesday that there is no basis for linking the existence of the Southern California fires or challenges in the firefighting effort to the water that is kept in the north of the state to protect the smelt and other species and ecosystems. Southern California does not have a shortage of water for fighting the fires. Mount said Trump’s claims in the social media post don’t make “any sense” and that “none of it is true.” He said the debate related to water in the northern Delta “has nothing to do with the fires in Southern California. There’s nothing.” It’s entirely possible we will learn that state or local leaders made policy or planning failures that impeded the firefighting effort in Los Angeles County. But there is no apparent link to the particular question Trump has repeatedly invoked and was discussing again in this social media post – which is about how much water should be sent from the north to Central Valley farms that are separated from the Los Angeles area by a mountain range. Whatever the merits or flaws of Newsom’s position on the protection of the smelt in the northern Delta, all but three of the state’s major reservoirs were filled at or above their historical averages as of Thursday morning. While it is true there were some dry hydrants in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles amid the extreme water demand of the firefighting effort, that significant problem was related to local logistical factors affected by the area’s mountainous geography – and possibly to the fact that a smaller reservoir located in the Pacific Palisades was closed for repairs, an issue Newsom ordered Friday to be independently investigated – not the absence of water in the Los Angeles region as a whole. “At no time was water scarcity in general an issue. Rather, there were local shortages of water during the firefight, principally due to infrastructure constraints. But Southern California has plenty of water in storage right now, so this was not a limiting factor,” Mount said. The fire crisis was caused by a combination of exceptionally high winds and the exceptionally dry state of the hilly brushland in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which has had minuscule rain for months. Trump’s proposals to send more water to Central Valley agricultural properties would not have shielded Los Angeles brushland that is not irrigated. Haddad said that Trump’s comments were so “stupid” that they should be ignored rather than discussed in detail. “There is no connection between environmental protection in northern California and low-flow fire hydrants in Pacific Palisades.” There are various other factual problems with Trump’s claims in the post. Trump’s vague claim that there are “not firefighting planes” is untrue. Firefighting aircraft were back in operation over Los Angeles County on Wednesday, armed with water, after being temporarily grounded starting Tuesday night because of high winds. The claim that there is “no water for fire hydrants” is an overstatement. Hydrants in other parts of Los Angeles County did have water even as the Pacific Palisades hydrants went dry. Advocates of preserving the Delta smelt want more water, not “less,” for the Delta area where the species lives. And contrary to Trump’s suggestion, Newsom hasn’t stopped water from flowing into the state entirely. This story has been updated to note that a reservoir in Pacific Palisades was closed for repairs at the time of the fire. CNN’s Ella Nilsen contributed to this article."
Andrew Cuomo is setting up a comeback try for NYC mayor,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/politics/andrew-cuomo-comeback-nyc-mayor/index.html,"At the end of September, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo quietly switched his voter registration address to an apartment on East 54th Street in Manhattan. It marked the first time he’d lived in New York City – officially – in decades. By December, he was ramping up conversations with local political officials and a select group of influential community leaders, hinting at plans to run for mayor in the June primary. What if, Cuomo mused, Eric Adams – who currently holds the job but is now facing an April trial date on federal corruption charges – resigned or opted out of running for reelection? He’s been telling donors and other influential political figures that if he gets in, he’s going to win, and they’ve got to get behind him. Elected governor three times before resigning in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations and fierce criticism over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, Cuomo is now privately describing his long-rumored and labored-over run for mayor as a near certainty, according to conversations with more than a dozen people in his orbit, with whom he has spoken recently but are not authorized to publicly discuss the deliberations. He is also lining up campaign aides and pollsters, in part with the help of a former top adviser who beat him out the door of the governor’s mansion more than three years ago after deciding she could no longer defend him against the flood of sexual misconduct accusations that ultimately forced him out of office. But he wouldn’t be the first Cuomo who put together an expected candidacy that never actually took off. Talk of a Cuomo comeback dates back, quite literally, to the day he resigned three-and-a-half years ago, with supporters and opponents alike either convinced or anxious, or both, that a revival bid was “imminent.” He eyed another run for governor, which would have meant taking on successor Kathy Hochul, the former lieutenant governor he always kept at arm’s length and who, in 2022, emerged as a politically weakened winner of a closer-than-expected gubernatorial election. The possibility of trying to oust her in 2026 is, as the February filing period for mayoral candidates approaches, one of the last things holding Cuomo back from jumping into the citywide stew. His ambitions were also fueled, in part, by his success in fending off lawsuits related to his alleged misconduct, which he denied before and after resigning, and a recent inspector general report suggesting then-President Donald Trump’s Justice Department, in 2020, sought to undermine him in the press. But it was not until Adams’ indictment last September that – as Cuomo himself might say – a new reality emerged. The mayor’s approval ratings are at historic lows and, barring a stunning about-face by federal prosecutors, he is slated to spend a large chunk of the primary campaign in a Lower Manhattan courtroom, while the sense spreads that street crime is even more out of control than it was when Adams won in 2021, promising he’d fix it. A Cuomo spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, chalked up anyone who has walked away from conversations with the former governor thinking that he’s definitely running to “a matter of perception.” Asked to explain those conversations, Azzopardi said, “A lot of people have come to him saying the city is in crisis and it needs to be fixed, and they think he’s the guy to do it because of his track record.” “He just hasn’t decided yet. It’s purely personal, it’s whether or not he wants to commit the time and the energy. He was 24-7 as governor. It’s a major commitment. It’s something he and his family are talking about,” Azzopardi added. He then texted a lengthy prepared statement touting the former governor’s record on issues that helped New Yorkers and brought money into infrastructure projects and noted Cuomo “will always be a Queens boy who loves New York, is deeply concerned about its direction, and will always help any way he can.” A defiant Adams on Thursday in his annual “state of the city” speech again insisted he has no plans to step down – then described a city better off for his leadership. “Don’t listen to the noise, don’t listen to the rhetoric,” Adams said. “New York City, the state of our city is strong.” But another Queens native is also shaping the race: President-elect Trump. The two have not spoken, but Cuomo has carefully observed his trajectory. People who have spoken with Cuomo say he thinks voters could be convinced to welcome him back, too — in the character of a tough guy who can set things right in a city wobbling with unease over public safety, an affordability crisis and post-pandemic trauma. Some around Cuomo think New Yorkers will also be looking for a tough guy to take on Trump, with aides floating the prospect of mass deportations targeted at Democratic cities. Adams’ legal team is led by attorney Alex Spiro, who also counts Elon Musk as a client, and is already deep into a public relations campaign against federal prosecutors, whom he claims – without evidence – moved against him in retaliation for his criticism of President Joe Biden’s border policy. (More than 200,000 migrants have arrived in the city since early 2022, causing a budget crunch and spiking social tensions.) Adams has further endangered his political standing with city Democrats by cozying up to Trump. The mayor’s allegations that he’s been targeted by a politicized Biden Justice Department rhyme with Trump’s own complaints about the handful of cases launched against him before he was reelected. Trump has expressed sympathy and support for Adams, who met with the president-elect’s incoming “border czar” in December to discuss how the city could potentially work with the administration on its mass deportation plan. For all the frustrations with migrants among city residents and the notably large shifts toward Trump across the city in November’s election, many New York political insiders believe that particularly in a Democratic primary, voters will want at least a somewhat oppositional force. According to those who have spoken with him and his circle, Cuomo figures that even with large parts of the city shifting toward Trump – or away from Democrats – during the 2024 general election, he could win over affluent White liberals who want a pugilist in office to square up with Trump (and try to keep their taxes down) to supplement his base. His critics are skeptical. “The best person to defeat a corrupt New York mayor can’t be a corrupt New York governor,” Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic consultant who helped run actress Cynthia Nixon’s 2018 primary challenge to Cuomo, told CNN. It is also unclear where Cuomo would break from Trump on the issues most likely to dominate the coming campaign. The president-elect, though still personally unpopular in New York, has pushed for a crackdown on crime and is planning a mass deportation program that many advocates expect will focus on undocumented immigrants in big cities. Already, the primary is much more crowded than tends to be the case for an incumbent mayor. But Cuomo is much better known than any of the other candidates in the race, and he’s been milking that in corners where he wants to build support, with appearances at Black churches and reiterating staunch support for Israel. He has millions of dollars in a leftover campaign account that he would be expected to direct into a supportive independent expenditure effort. Earlier this week, the mayor himself juiced speculation about Cuomo’s plans by taking direct aim at the former governor’s record in a rare – at least since he was indicted and his administration began to unravel – wide-ranging interview with Politico. “People who are running – they’re going to have to take claim for the stuff that they did when they were holding office,” Adams said. Adams raised the nearly six-year-old decision to reform bail laws, which took root among progressive state lawmakers toward the end of Cuomo’s time in office. And Adams isn’t the only one raring to go. After months of trial balloons and rumors, the candidates who would be Cuomo’s rivals are already dug in, trying to remind voters of other controversies beyond the best-known scandals. “If and when Cuomo pops his head back up, (voters) will consider his mishandling of COVID-19, the nursing home scandal, and the congressional investigation into his conduct,” former Comptroller Scott Stringer’s campaign wrote in a memo late last year. “They also remember how he nearly destroyed the (public transit system), leaving the lifeblood of our city, our subway system, in shambles for hypothetical votes upstate.” A Cuomo mayoral campaign would be naturally divisive. In what will be only the second mayoral election to conducted under ranked-choice voting rules – a process that even some of the city’s shrewdest operatives confess remains an election day wild card – that might help him. He warred with the former mayor, Bill de Blasio, during the seven years they ran the state and city, respectively, clashing over everything from public transit funding and housing to the fate of a wounded deer and the utility of a midday nap. Asked about his thoughts on Cuomo’s possibly running for his old job, de Blasio texted CNN, “Well, that’s a good question… I haven’t really determined if/how/when to share my thoughts…” As he tightened his grip on state government, Cuomo became deeply unpopular with many liberals in New York City, where the progressive Working Families Party lined up as his most bitter opponents – only to see their coalition split, with major labor unions leaving, over the WFP’s attempts to unseat him. Still, Cuomo is despised by many on the left, personally and politically, and even by Democrats beyond that who want a new start. “If a city has ever been crying out for new leadership, it’s New York at this moment – and Cuomo is the antithesis of new leadership,” said one Democratic strategist who knows the former governor. Without the power of being in office to flex against political enemies, strategists believe he will not be as much of a threat. They think his campaign might flare up early but then collapse, much like businessman and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s did four years ago. Still, with Adams and nearly all of his inner circle swallowed up in legal troubles and ethical scandals, and the city on edge over a post-Covid rise in crime, the mayoral contest has become more a more appealing proposition. In a further wrinkle, Cuomo and Adams – if they were to both run – would be competing for many of the same primary voters. Adams’s base largely overlaps with the neighborhoods and constituencies that consistently turned out in force for Cuomo during his three successful gubernatorial campaigns. Concerns over how that bloc – comprised of Black working class voters and other ethnic outer-borough cohorts – would breakdown with both men on the ballot had, sources familiar with Cuomo’s thinking told CNN, been a potential roadblock to his entering the race. The conventional wisdom among Democratic strategists, until the last week, had been that Cuomo would not seek to challenge Adams in primary, preferring the mayor step down and, by law, trigger a nonpartisan special election. “There were some who said, ‘step down,’” Adams crowed during his state of the city speech. “I said, ‘No, I’m gonna step up.’” All of this has left many of the city’s power brokers holding off supporting anyone, at least for now. In an interview last fall, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries – who remains very involved in city politics and eventually backed Adams in 2021 – told CNN that he believes Adams is entitled to the presumption of innocence and the right to go to trial. But Jeffries demurred when asked if he’d be ready to support Adams for reelection. “We’ll cross that bridge,” he said, “when we get to it.” CNN’s Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report.

Biden slams Meta’s decision to get rid of fact-checking in wide-ranging Q-and-A with reporters,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/joe-biden-meta-donald-trump/index.html,"President Joe Biden said Friday that Meta’s decision to get rid of fact checkers and replace them with user-generated community notes is “really shameful” as he answered questions from reporters on a number of subjects following a speech on the economy. Biden appeared in the Roosevelt Room Friday evening to tout the latest jobs report and marking four years of continuous job growth under his administration. It was after that speech that the president took questions on Meta’s decision to get rid of fact checking, his post-presidency plans, new sanctions on Russia, possible pardons he may issue before his term is up in a week and a half, and Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, among other topics. As part of the question-and-answer session, Biden was asked about the changes to Meta’s fact-checking process, announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg just before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump and other Republicans have lambasted Zuckerberg and Meta for what they view as censorship of right-wing voices. Zuckerberg, however, acknowledged a “tradeoff” in the new policy, noting more harmful content will appear on the platform as a result of the content moderation changes. “The idea that, you know, a billionaire can buy something and say, ‘By the way, from this point on, we’re not going to we’re not going to fact check anything.’ And you know, when you have millions of people reading, going online, reading this stuff … I think it’s really shameful,” Biden said. The moderation changes mark a stunning reversal in how Meta handles false and misleading claims on its platforms. In 2016, the company launched an independent fact-checking program, in the wake of claims that it had failed to stop foreign actors from leveraging its platforms to spread disinformation and sow discord among Americans. In the years since, it continued to grapple with the spread of controversial content on its platform, such as misinformation about elections, anti-vaccination stories, violence and hate speech. But now, Zuckerberg is following in the footsteps of fellow social media leader Elon Musk who, after acquiring X, then known as Twitter, in 2022, dismantled the company’s fact-checking teams and made user-generated context labels, called “community notes,” the platform’s only method of correcting false claims. “Fact checkers have been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they’ve created,” Zuckerberg said in a video announcing the new policy Tuesday. Biden told reporters he is watching to see if Trump telegraphs whether he might “punish people” when he takes power before making any decisions about whether to issue additional pardons in his final days in office. “It depends on some of the language and expectations that Trump broadcasts in the last couple of days here as to what he’s going to do,” the president said when asked about what pardons and commutations he’s considering. “The idea that he would punish people for not adhering to what he thinks should be policy as it related to his well being is outrageous,” Biden said. “But there’s still consideration of some folks, but no decision.” Asked if he’d rule out a pardon for himself or his family, Biden appeared taken aback, saying, “What would I pardon myself for?” “No, I have no contemplation of pardoning myself for anything,” he added. “I didn’t do anything wrong.” The president did not offer further details about who he is considering pardoning. In an interview with USA Today last weekend, the president said he had not made a decision about issuing preemptive pardons before leaving office, leaving the door open to an unprecedented move to protect some of his allies as he warned Trump against trying to “settle scores.” CNN has previously reported senior White House officials, administration officials and prominent defense attorneys in Washington, DC, have discussed potential preemptive pardons or legal aid for individuals who might be targets for prosecution by Trump after he takes power. Biden said that Harris “could have” and “would have” beaten Trump in the 2024 presidential election. “I think I would have beaten Trump, could’ve beaten Trump. I think Kamala could have beaten Trump, would have beaten Trump,” Biden said The president then said he was “confident she could win” the 2024 election at the time he made his decision last summer. “When the party was worried about whether or not I was going to be able to move I thought, even though I thought I could win again, I thought it was better to unify the party, and it was the greatest honor in my life to be president of the United States, but I didn’t want to be one who caused a party that wasn’t unified to lose an election, and that’s why I stepped aside, but I was confident she could win,” Biden added. Trump won the 2024 election, receiving 312 electoral votes, while Harris received 226. Asked if Harris should run again in 2028 for the Democratic nomination for president, Biden told reporters that is a decision that the vice president should make. “I think that’s a decision she should make,” Biden said. “I think she’s competent to run again in four years, that’d be a decision for her to make.” Biden told reporters Friday that he would not comment on new intelligence suggesting the mysterious illness known as “Havana syndrome” was possibly caused by a foreign weapon. “I don’t have a full brief on that right now. I’m not going to comment on that,” Biden said. Initially, Biden appeared to mishear the reporter’s question on Havana syndrome – and instead, offered a lengthy and detailed answer on homegrown terrorism in relation to the Nevada and Louisiana New Year’s Day incidents. As CNN reported earlier Friday, new intelligence has led two US intelligence agencies to conclude that it’s possible a small number of the mysterious health ailments. impacting spies, soldiers and diplomats around the world may have been caused by a “novel weapon” wielded by a foreign actor, according to intelligence officials and a new unclassified summary report. Biden said Friday that we will not be “out of sight, out of mind,” when asked what kind of role he will have post presidency by a reporter after delivering remarks at the White House on the economy. A reporter asked if Biden planned to stay involved in the political process after leaving office or if he would follow George W. Bush’s model of stepping back and staying out of current affairs. “I’m not gonna be out of sight or out of mind,” Biden answered."
"Supreme Court to review Obamacare’s no-cost coverage of cancer screenings, heart statins and HIV drugs",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/obamacare-supreme-court-hiv-prep-cancer-screening-heart-statin/index.html,"The Supreme Court said Friday it will review the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act’s no-cost coverage mandates for certain preventive care services, putting the landmark health care law in front of the justices again just as President-elect Donald Trump – who tried to repeal the law during his first presidency – returns to the White House. While not an existential threat to Obamacare, the case could imperil access Americans have to cost-free preventive treatments and services, including HIV prevention medications, heart statins and various screenings for cancers and other diseases. The cost of some of these preventive services can be substantial, which would deter some people – particularly those with lower incomes – from accessing the care and slow the early detection of potentially deadly illnesses. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the mandates in question, based on the recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force, violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are not appointed by the president with Senate confirmation. The 5th Circuit’s ruling was directed at no-cost coverage requirements implemented after Obamacare’s enactment in March 2010. The appellate ruling only blocked the mandates as applied to the challengers of the specific case, a Texas business and several individuals. But both the Biden administration and the challengers agreed that the 5th Circuit’s precedent set the stage for another party to sue to block the mandates nationwide, and both sides had asked the Supreme Court to take up the case. Among the other no-cost coverage mandates that are put at risk by the 5th Circuit ruling are prenatal nutritional supplements, physical therapy for older Americans to prevent falls and lung cancer screenings that, according to the Biden administration, could save the lives of 10,000 to 20,000 Americans a year. A variety of other no-cost preventive services – such as well-baby visits and autism screenings for children, cervical cancer screenings and breastfeeding support programs for women, and flu, measles and chickenpox vaccines – are not at issue in the case. Studies have shown the Obamacare mandate prompted an uptake in preventive services and narrowed care disparities in communities of color. “Even modest out of pocket costs mean that people don’t end up seeking out these services,” Zachary Baron, a director of the O’Neill Institute’s Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University, told CNN. “They end up pushing things off as they’re trying to juggle various bills.” In her petition that the Supreme Court take up the case, US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote that the 5th Circuit ruling “jeopardizes healthcare protections that have been in place for 14 years and that millions of Americans currently enjoy.” “This Court’s review is warranted because the court of appeals has held an Act of Congress unconstitutional and its legal rationale would inflict immense practical harms,” she wrote, later adding that the justices should also take up the case because the appellate “decision threatens to disrupt a key part of the ACA that provides healthcare protections for millions of Americans.” The challengers also urged the Supreme Court to take up the case, even as they argued that the 5th Circuit’s ruling was “well-reasoned and correct.” They pointed to the Supreme Court’s typical practice of granting cases where an act of Congress was deemed unconstitutional by a lower court. The Texas business, Braidwood, sued over the mandates because the company had moral objections to covering the HIV prevention medications – known as PrEP. The company also objected to paying for insurance that covered screenings for sexually transmitted diseases and other treatments related to conduct the employer morally opposed. The lawsuit was first filed in 2020, and at the time, the Trump administration defended the Affordable Care Act’s requirements. Representing the company is Gene Hamilton, an alum of the first Trump administration Justice Department, who now, alongside Trump adviser Stephen Miller, leads the legal advocacy organization America First Legal. Also representing the challengers is Jonathan Mitchell, who argued on Trump’s behalf in the Colorado ballot access case before the Supreme Court last term.

Federal judge slams Rudy Giuliani as ‘outrageous and shameful’ as she holds him in contempt in 2020 election defamation case,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/rudy-giuliani-contempt-hearing-defamation-case/index.html,"Rudy Giuliani has been held in contempt of court for the second time in a week, as the former New York mayor and top Donald Trump lawyer’s fall from grace continues because of the false information he spread after the 2020 election. District Judge Beryl Howell’s ruling Friday came as Giuliani continues to make false insinuations about two Georgia election workers, long after they won a $150 million defamation verdict against him and he agreed to stop slandering them. “Mr Giuliani engaged in the worst kind of defamation,” Howell said as she read her verdict, slamming him for continuing to portray himself as a victim in this case and not responding to previous court orders. “It is outrageous and shameful,” Howell said. “This takes real chutzpah, Mr Giuliani.” Following the hearing, Giuliani told reporters he believes Howell is “not American” because she had her “opinion written before” the hearing. He then compared her to Soviets and Nazis. In addition to finding Giuliani in contempt, Howell ordered that within 10 days - Trump’s Inauguration Day – he must swear in a statement sent to the court that he’s reviewed and acknowledges several records showing that there was no fraud in the 2020 election. If he doesn’t do that, he’ll be fined $200 a day. In late 2023, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, told a jury of the violent threats they received after Giuliani’s lies about the 2020 election and how they ruined their livelihoods. After that trial, Moss and Freeman complained to Howell that on recent broadcasts of Giuliani’s show, he said people were quadruple-counting ballots and passing hard drives to rig vote-counting machines. Those insinuations were false, and they were among the types of comments Giuliani had agreed not to repeat anymore in a settlement that Howell approved months ago. Officials and courts have repeatedly concluded there was no conspiracy to change votes against Trump in Georgia in 2020, a state where he closely lost the election to Joe Biden. At one point in his recent broadcasts, Giuliani said: “I’m sorry they’re going to sue me again for saying it but what am I going to do but tell the truth.” Giuliani arrived at court Friday morning, and by lunchtime was posting on social media attacks against the judge even before his hearing began. He said Howell was “making us wait all day for her inevitable highly prejudiced, usual, biased decision … The hearing is a hypocritical waste of time.” Over the course of the three-hour hearing, Giuliani and his team took multiple breaks – including at one point sitting in the courtroom without the judge on the bench to pore over paperwork on what assets he still has. He also briefly took the witness stand to verify documents about money he has in accounts and his ability to maintain his $3.5 million Florida condo. Several times, the former mayor held his head in his hand, spoke directly to the judge or walked out of the room with Howell still on the bench. Giuliani will also owe what is likely to be several thousands of dollars for their attorneys’ work on this contempt proceeding. Monday, in a separate proceeding in Manhattan’s federal court, Judge Lewis Liman said Giuliani was in contempt for failing to turn over information to Moss and Freeman’s lawyers. They are preparing for a trial next week over whether Giuliani must relinquish the $3.5 million Palm Beach condo where he says he lives as well as four Yankees World Series championship rings to pay some of his debt. Liman is still considering whether Giuliani should be held in contempt again for not turning over luxury items he has, like a signed Joe DiMaggio jersey, to Moss and Freeman months ago. Giuliani, 80, has appeared to be in poor health, and he has said in a recent court filing he is suffering from knee, heart and lung conditions. His spokesman in recent statements has said Giuliani still has his “extraordinary record of public service.” This story has been updated with additional developments."
New intelligence suggests ‘Havana Syndrome’ possibly caused by foreign weapon; overall assessment remains ‘very unlikely’,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/new-evidence-havana-syndrome/index.html,"New intelligence has led two US intelligence agencies to conclude that it’s possible a small number of mysterious health ailments colloquially termed as Havana Syndrome impacting spies, soldiers and diplomats around the world may have been caused by a “novel weapon” wielded by a foreign actor, according to intelligence officials and a new unclassified summary report released on Friday. However, the two agencies are in the minority and the broader intelligence community assessment remains that it is very unlikely that the symptoms were caused by a foreign actor, according to the unclassified report summary issued Friday — even as an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence emphasized that analysts cannot “rule out” the possibility in some small number of cases. The subtle, technocratic shift in the assessment over the cause of Havana Syndrome has reignited a bitter debate that has split US officials, Capitol Hill and victims over the likelihood that the bizarre injuries were caused by a weapon or a host of disparate, natural causes. Sometime in the last two years, the US received new intelligence that indicated a foreign nation’s directed energy research programs had been “making progress,” according to the official. That led one unnamed intelligence agency to assess that there was a “roughly even chance” that a foreign country has used some kind of novel weapon against a small group of victims, causing the symptoms that the government officially calls “anomalous health incidents” — headaches, vertigo and even, in some cases, signs of traumatic brain injury. A second intelligence agency assessed a “roughly even” chance that a foreign actor possessed such a weapon but is unlikely to have deployed it against US personnel. According to two former intelligence officials, one of those agencies is the National Security Agency. But both judgments were made with low confidence, according to the ODNI official. And critically, possessing a capability is not the same as proof that it has been used. “All IC components agree that years of IC collection, targeting and analytic efforts have not surfaced compelling intelligence reporting that ties a foreign actor to any specific event reported as a possible (anomalous health incident),” the official said Friday. In fact, the official said, some evidence directly contradicts the notion that a foreign government was involved. Intelligence collection “indicates foreign adversaries who the IC identifies as credible in organizations that would know either expressing surprise or denying their involvement privately,” the official said. The White House emphasized that research to determine the causes of the incidents is ongoing, and briefings are planned with the incoming Trump administration so that they continue the work. “We have to approach this with humility. We don’t have all of the answers, and it’s going to require interdisciplinary work, bringing in expertise from inside and outside of the government to understand what may have caused this,” a senior administration official said. But the latest findings have nevertheless incensed victims, many of whom believe strongly that intelligence exists offering black-and-white evidence that Russia is behind their symptoms, some of which have been severe enough to force retirement. It has also put the intelligence community at odds with the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee, which last month issued a report that found it was “increasingly likely” that a foreign adversary was behind the episodes. “This see-no-evil ridiculous assessment not only covers for Russia but proves the point of the recent House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) report,” said Mark Lenzi, a State Department officer who was medically evacuated from China in 2018 and later diagnosed with traumatic brain injury. Another victim referred to the intelligence community’s unwillingness to blame foreign adversaries as “gaslighting.” For more than a year, anger has been building in the community of victims at what some see as a deliberate unwillingness at the CIA, which has led investigatory efforts, to accurately assess the likelihood that another nation — Russia — was using some kind of directed energy weapon to cause the injuries. The fundamental disagreement over the evidence of Russia’s involvement has led to deep disillusionment, distrust and increasingly pitched friction between the victims of Havana syndrome and the government agencies charged with investigating it. And because most of the evidence for either side of the ledger is classified, the debate has become a frustrating case of he said, she said. On Friday, officials emphasized that the intelligence community is now supporting lab work on whether radio frequencies can cause “bioeffects” in line with what victims have reported. The latest findings from limited studies have shown mixed results, while previously most results had shown no effects, officials said. A panel of experts assembled by the intelligence community that studied a smaller set of incidents previously found that the symptoms might be explained by “pulsed electromagnetic or acoustic energy,” as opposed to environmental or medical conditions. “There was unanimous judgment by the panel that the most plausible explanation for a subset of cases was exposure to directed energy,” a second senior administration official said. But complicating matters for victims and analysts is the fact that not all of those reporting AHIs have the same set of symptoms — and the vast majority of cases have been explained by other causes, officials have previously said. Intelligence and administration officials have been at pains to emphasize that even as they have not assessed Russia is behind the injuries, they do not doubt that the injuries are real and deserving of government compensation. In November, key officials at the National Security Council invited a group of six victims to attend a meeting in the Situation Room.  A participant, a former US intelligence official, told CNN the meeting was called to discuss how the Biden administration should advise the incoming Trump team to proceed with the ongoing investigative efforts to get to the bottom of the cause or causes behind the injuries. “These are our colleagues who have been affected, sometimes with debilitating injuries. And we have made it abundantly clear that we believe that they have faced serious harm, and that they are that they deserve the support and care that they need,” the first senior administration official said. The ODNI official fiercely pushed back on the notion that the intelligence community was pulling punches in its assessment. “To me, integrity is doing what’s right and true even in the face of impossible pressures,” the official said, noting that many of those reporting anomalous health incidents, or AHIs, are friends and colleagues of the analysts trying to assess what happened to them. “We follow the facts wherever they lead, and many of us were surprised by the results,” the official said. “We do not question the experience of our colleagues. Our analysis is focused only on considering foreign responsibility, and the intelligence does not link a foreign actor to these events. Indeed, it points away from their involvement. And analytic integrity is saying just that.”"
Biden extends temporary deportation protections for nearly 1 million immigrants ahead of anticipated Trump crackdown,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/biden-extends-temporary-deportation-protections/index.html,"The Biden administration on Friday extended temporary deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants residing in the United States as communities brace for the incoming Trump administration. The relief – known as Temporary Protected Status – applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters, therefore the protections are limited to people already in the United States. Republican and Democratic administrations have designated the protections. Friday’s announcement applies to people from El Salvador, Sudan, Ukraine and Venezuela – shielding them from deportation for another 18 months, starting from the expiration of the current protection, and allowing to remain in the US with work permits. In his first term, Trump tried to end TPS for El Salvador, among other countries, but faced legal challenges. Immigrant advocates and Democratic lawmakers have been urging the Biden White House to do more to protect immigrants in the United States who fear losing their protections and ability to work in the country when Trump takes office. Temporary protections for El Salvador, Ukraine, Venezuela and Sudan were set to expire in the spring and expected to be renewed before Trump’s inauguration. The DHS secretary must decide at least 60 days prior whether to extend or terminate the designation based on country conditions. The decision grants relief to roughly 232,000 Salvadorans; 1,900 Sudanese; 104,000 Ukrainians; and 600,000 Venezuelans, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Friday’s announcement doesn’t expand the pool of people eligible for TPS."
Chinese hackers breached US government office that assesses foreign investments for national security risks,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/chinese-hackers-breach-committee-on-foreign-investment-in-the-us/index.html,"Chinese hackers breached the US government office that reviews foreign investments for national security risks, three US officials familiar with the matter told CNN. The theft, which has not previously been reported, underscores Beijing’s keen interest in spying on a US government office that has broad powers to block Chinese investment in the US as tensions between the world’s two superpowers remain high. The breach was part of a broader incursion by the hackers into the Treasury Department’s unclassified system. The office targeted by the hackers, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), in December gained greater authority to scrutinize real estate sales near US military bases. US lawmakers and national security officials have grown increasingly worried that the Chinese government or its proxies could use land acquisitions to spy on those bases. It’s just one in a string of alleged Chinese cyber-espionage campaigns that have rattled the US government in the last year and that will challenge the incoming Trump administration. A separate Chinese hacking group burrowed deep into US telecom networks to spy on the phone communications of senior US political figures, including President-elect Donald Trump, CNN previously reported. US officials are scrambling to assess any fallout to national security from the hack of unclassified information, which Treasury disclosed to lawmakers last week. The hackers also targeted Treasury’s sanctions office, which just last week sanctioned a Chinese company for its alleged role in cyberattacks, two of the US officials told CNN. The Washington Post first reported the sanctions office was targeted. It was not immediately clear what information the hackers stole from Treasury computers. US officials are reviewing the individual documents that the hackers accessed and will do an analysis assessing the overall national security impact of the stolen information, one of the US officials said. While there is no evidence that classified information was accessed, there is a concern that, pieced together, the unclassified information could provide useful intelligence to the Chinese. A Treasury spokesperson did not respond to questions about the hackers targeting of CFIUS and instead shared a previous statement from the department. The hackers compromised a “third-party service provider” last month and were “able to remotely access several Treasury user workstations and certain unclassified documents maintained by those users,” the Treasury spokesperson said. The department has worked “with law enforcement partners across the government to ascertain the impact of this incident” and there is no evidence the hackers have continued access to Treasury systems or information, the statement continued. “Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,” the spokesperson said. “Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.” Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, reiterated China’s longstanding denials that it engages in hacking operations. “During his meeting with President Biden in Lima [last] year, President Xi Jinping said that there is no evidence that supports the irrational claim of the so-called ‘cyberattacks from China,’” Liu said in an email. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC the hack is “not something that builds confidence in our relationship [with China]” and that she raised the issue with her Chinese counterpart in a call this week. Yellen leads CFIUS, which includes other Cabinet heads such as the secretaries of defense and homeland security. Once an obscure office, CFIUS has grown in stature as US-China competition has grown more complicated and extended to business transactions in remote parts of the US. CNN first reported on a CFIUS review in 2023 of a company that bought up hundreds of millions of dollars of land in a county near a key Air Force base in California. The incoming Trump administration is set to include multiple Cabinet members or other senior staff who have called for tougher measures on China over national security concerns, including incoming national security adviser Rep. Mike Waltz and Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump’s choice for secretary of state. US military and spy agencies already engage in offensive cyber operations against China, but Waltz says he wants more action to be taken. “America can’t afford to just play defense on cyber anymore,” Waltz posted on X last month. “We’ve got to go on the offensive and impose COSTS on those who are stealing our technology and attacking our infrastructure.”"
Trump Organization’s new ethics plan pledges Donald Trump will separate himself from his private business interests,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/trump-organization-new-ethics-plan/index.html,"The Trump Organization on Friday announced that President-elect Donald Trump will not have any involvement in managing his real estate and branding empire during his second term and appointed an outside ethics adviser to monitor major company actions – part of several measures the organization said it was taking to avoid conflicts of interest as Trump prepares to return to the White House later this month. The provisions, for the most part, mirror steps announced during the first Trump administration. Under its plan, the company pledged not to enter into any new deals with foreign governments and voluntarily donate to the US Treasury any profits from foreign governments that it can identify flowing into its hotels and other properties. The ethics pledge, however, is silent on how the company will handle overseas business deals. And Trump’s son Eric Trump, the company’s executive vice president, has previously said that the firm will continue to pursue foreign business during his father’s second term, relaxing a self-imposed restriction that the company has said was in place during the first term. In a statement, the Trump Organization noted that the incoming president is not required either by federal law or the US Constitution to remove himself from his business interests. Even so, Eric Trump said, the company “is dedicated to not just meeting but vastly exceeding its legal and ethical obligations during my father’s Presidency.” He called the ethical standards announced Friday “robust.” The younger Trump, who essentially guides the company day-to-day, also announced that prominent Republican lawyer William Burck will serve as an outside adviser to review major transactions to avoid ethics problems. The plan unveiled Friday pledges that Donald Trump will have “limited access” to the company’s financial information. Additionally, his businesses will remain in a trust, managed by his children, and his investments will be overseen by outside financial institutions that will “neither solicit nor accept input” from Trump. Although Trump is not required to take these steps, previous presidents have moved more aggressively to divest themselves of their businesses or place their holdings in blind trusts to avoid the appearance of self-dealing – a distinction often noted by ethics watchdogs during Trump’s political career. And, as CNN has previously reported, the incoming president has pursued new business deals in recent months – including joining his family in a cryptocurrency venture and promoting new merchandise touting his electoral victory."
Biden admin imposes harsh sanctions on Russian oil industry to cut off funding for Ukraine war effort,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/biden-admin-russia-energy-sanctions-ukraine/index.html,"The Biden administration on Friday targeted Russia’s energy sector, including its oil industry, with some of its harshest sanctions to date meant to cut off funding for Moscow’s war against Ukraine. The sweeping moves, taken just over a week before President Joe Biden leaves office, come as President-elect Donald Trump says he is readying to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. They also have the potential to unnerve investors in energy markets. US senior administration officials said they want to leave Kyiv – and the incoming Trump administration – with the strongest possible hand for potential negotiations. Those officials expressed hope that the next administration would maintain and enforce the sanctions, despite previous skepticism from some Trump officials about the effectiveness of such measures. The new sanctions against “the Kremlin’s largest and most important source of revenue” hit hundreds of targets, including two of Russia’s largest oil companies: Public Joint Stock Company Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas. The sanctions also target nearly 200 oil-carrying vessels, many of which are accused of being part of the so-called “shadow fleet” that works to evade sanctions, as well as oil traders and energy officials. They also go after Russia’s liquified natural gas (LNG) production and export. “We expect our actions to cost Russia upwards of billions of dollars per month,” a senior administration official said. The sanctions, introduced in coordination with the United Kingdom, are part of the administration’s broader approach to bolstering Kyiv. The Biden administration on Thursday announced its final tranche of military aid for Ukraine, valued at around $500 million. The Pentagon said Friday that there will be “just under $4 billion” in funding from the Presidential Drawdown Authority that will roll over to the incoming Trump administration for funding aid to Ukraine. “These sanctions, in addition to the actions we’ve taken over the last several weeks, help put Ukraine in a position in which they have the ability to work with the incoming administration to try and find a just peace,” a second senior administration official said. On Thursday, Trump reiterated his desire to end the war in Ukraine, saying that Putin “wants to meet, and we’re setting it up.” “President Putin wants to meet — he’s said that even publicly — and we have to get that war over with. That’s a bloody mess,” he said. The first senior administration official acknowledged “it’s entirely up to” the Trump team “to determine whether, when and on what terms they might lift any sanctions we’ve put into place.” Moreover, the strength of the sanctions will depend largely on enforcement, with one official noting that “we have to match every circumvention with a countermeasure, and that will take political will.” “Russia is going to make every effort to circumvent these sanctions. It’s inevitable,” the first official said. “But circumvention is not costless. Russia has had a constant need to adapt and reorient its supply chains. That creates inefficiency. It creates uncertainty. It creates complexity. So our sanctions are like pounds of sand into the gears of Russia’s war machine,” they said. Friday’s measures do not have secondary sanctions against specific countries, officials said. China and India have been top importers of Russian oil throughout the war in Ukraine. Officials argued that they waited until the waning days of the administration to impose the sanctions in part because of the state of the global oil market and the potential impact on the US economy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 sparked fears of major supply disruptions from one of the world’s leading producers. Oil prices spiked to as high as $130 a barrel in March 2022, contributing to the inflation crisis across the US economy and pushing gasoline prices to all-time highs. “During much of this war, global supplies were tight and at risk of falling short of demand,” the first senior administration official explained, noting that would have likely increased revenues to Russia “while raising prices at the gas pump for families in the United States and across the world.” Now, the official said, both oil markets and the US economy “are in a fundamentally better place.” The United States is producing more oil than any nation in world history, forcing OPEC to dial back supply. Oil prices have been relatively subdued, in part because of record-shattering US production. Still, oil prices climbed sharply Friday morning, even before the official sanctions announcement, with some traders blaming rumored sanctions. US crude jumped 4% to nearly $77 a barrel. Brent crude, the world benchmark, advanced 3.7% to about $80 a barrel."
Tulsi Gabbard changes tone on surveillance powers she once sought to dismantle,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/tulsi-gabbard-changes-tone-domestic-surveillance/index.html,"President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to serve as director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, is voicing support for a key government surveillance authority she once sought to dismantle. The shift comes amid lingering uncertainty about Gabbard’s path to confirmation despite her having spent the last several weeks meeting with senators on both sides of the aisle in an effort to win their support. In a new statement to CNN on Friday, Gabbard said she will support FISA Section 702 — an intelligence gathering tool passed by Congress after September 11, 2001 — if confirmed as Trump’s spy chief, marking a dramatic shift from her previous attempts to repeal the same authority and comments raising deep concerns about domestic surveillance. “Section 702, unlike other FISA authorities, is crucial for gathering foreign intelligence on non-U.S. persons abroad. This unique capability cannot be replicated and must be safeguarded to protect our nation while ensuring the civil liberties of Americans,” Gabbard said in the statement to CNN. “My prior concerns about FISA were based on insufficient protections for civil liberties, particularly regarding the FBI’s misuse of warrantless search powers on American citizens. Significant FISA reforms have been enacted since my time in Congress to address these issues. If confirmed as DNI, I will uphold Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights while maintaining vital national security tools like Section 702 to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people,” she added. Gabbard also met Friday with the current director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, according to a source familiar with the matter, who declined to provide additional details about what was discussed. The meeting comes as Senate Republicans have been pushing to hold a confirmation hearing for Gabbard before Trump’s inauguration, but Democrats are resisting setting a date for next week as the Intelligence Committee has not yet received key paperwork on the nomination, including an FBI background check, two sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN. Trump’s selection of Gabbard to run the Office of the Director of National Intelligence quickly drew scrutiny because of her relative inexperience in the intelligence community and her public adoption of positions on Syria and the war in Ukraine that many national security officials see as Russian propaganda. But where she is perhaps most at odds with the agencies she may soon be tasked with leading is her distrust of broad government surveillance authorities and her support for those willing to expose some of the intelligence community’s most sensitive secrets. Gabbard’s confirmation would make her the most markedly anti-surveillance official to lead the intelligence community in the post-9/11 era. Her previous animus toward what she has described as the “national security state and its warmongering friends,” hell-bent on using the Espionage Act and other tools to punish its enemies, has raised questions about whether she might seek to reshape the rules by which American intelligence agencies have been collecting, searching and using intelligence for decades. In December 2020, shortly before she left Congress, Gabbard introduced legislation that would repeal the Patriot Act and Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Like her other legislative attempts on spying issues, it went nowhere. But Gabbard’s disdain for government surveillance powers —  and her aggrieved sense that Americans have been lied to about those authorities — are among her most coherent and consistent national security positions, even as Gabbard has transformed from a Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate to a potential Cabinet member in the new Trump administration. In 2017, when Trump was challenging the credibility of the FBI’s investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer warned him: “You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.” Gabbard, then a Democrat, heard a “chilling message,” she wrote in her memoir: “The intelligence community and national security state are so supremely powerful and accountable to no one that even the president of the United States better not dare criticize them.” Punchbowl was first to report Gabbard’s statement regarding FISA Section 702."
Supreme Court signals it will uphold ban on TikTok over national security concerns and other takeaways from oral arguments,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/politics/takeaways-tiktok-supreme-court/index.html,"A majority of the Supreme Court appeared likely to uphold a controversial ban on TikTok over concerns about its ties to China, with justices lobbing pointed questions at lawyers for the social media app and a group of its content creators. During more than two hours of oral arguments, many of the justices appeared to view the sell-or-ban law approved by Congress in April not as one that primarily implicates the First Amendment but rather as an effort to regulate the potential foreign control of an app used by 170 million Americans. The law, which would restrict the app’s operations in the United States if its Chinese-based parent company ByteDance did not divest from the platform, is set to take effect on January 19 unless the high court steps in to block it temporarily. A decision on that question – the ban’s implementation date – could come quickly, long before the justices resolve any underlying questions about speech protections. Two presidents – Donald Trump and Joe Biden – have both raised concerns in the past about both content manipulation on the platform and its data collection practices. TikTok argued those concerns were speculative and resisted any suggestion that the Chinese government had a role in picking the cat videos, recipes and news that millions of Americans view on the app. Here are the key takeaways from Friday’s oral arguments: Justices across the ideological spectrum raised doubts that the TikTok ban even implicated the First Amendment. That’s a bad sign for TikTok, because to win, it had to prove first that the First Amendment applies in the case and then that the law has failed to meet its tests. In an exchange with a lawyer for users of the application, Chief Justice John Roberts said that, in passing the law, Congress was “fine with the expression.” “They’re not fine with a foreign adversary, as they’ve determined it is, gathering all this information about the 170 million people who use TikTok,” he said. Roberts also pressed TikTok’s lawyer on the lack of precedent of the court striking down a law, on First Amendment grounds, that was crafted around regulating a company’s corporate structure. Justice Elena Kagan also had questions suggesting she wasn’t sure the First Amendment even applied in this case, though later in the arguments she also had skeptical questions for the government. “The law is only targeted at this foreign corporation, which doesn’t have First Amendment rights,” she said to the lawyer arguing on TikTok’s behalf. Traditionally, the Supreme Court has deferred to the other branches of government when it comes to national security. That is precisely why Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar focused on that issue so heavily during her arguments. “For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans – where we live and work, who are friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,” Prelogar, making her final argument on behalf of the Biden administration, told the Supreme Court. TikTok’s “immense data set,” she said, would give China “a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.” That argument appeared persuasive to both Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another conservative who is often at the ideological center of the court. Congress and the president, Kavanaugh said, “were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans – tens of millions of Americans – including teenagers, people in their twenties” and that the country might use that information “to turn people, to blackmail people – people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department.” Throughout the course of the arguments, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch appeared to be the most concerned with the ban. “Don’t we normally assume that the best remedy for problematic speech is counter speech?” Gorsuch asked, taking up a suggestion from TikTok that Congress should have considered warning labels for the platform rather than an outright ban. “TikTok,” Gorsuch pointed out, “says it could even live with a disclaimer on its website saying this can be covertly manipulated by China.” On a court that has reliably expanded First Amendment rights for several decades, Gorsuch expressed reservations about the government’s theory that those protections don’t even apply in this case. To underscore those concerns, he raised a hypothetical about a foreign-owned newspaper. Could the government attempt to shut down that hypothetical platform under its theory, he asked. One of the important differences between a newspaper and social media platform, Prelogar responded, is that users of social media operate under an assumption that “it’s organically feeding them videos based on the recommendation engine.” Newspapers, she said, operate more like one-way modes of communication. Kagan, who peppered both sides of the case with difficult questions, raised similar themes. She pointed to the nation’s history of allowing foreign messages into the United States, including communist propaganda during the height of the Cold War that may have had ties to the Soviet Union. “You know, in the mid-20th century, we were very concerned about the Soviet Union, and what the Soviet Union was doing in this country,” Kagan said. If Congress had told the Communist Party in the United States that it had to cut ties with the Soviet Union, “do you think that that would have been absolutely fine?” Unless the Supreme Court acts block the law, TikTok “will go dark” starting on January 19, its attorney, Noel Francisco, said. “On January 19, as I understand it, we shut down,” he said. Francisco, a former solicitor general during the Trump administration, said he expects TikTok to be removed from app stores “at a minimum.” “But in addition, what the act says is that all of the other types of service providers can’t provide service either,” he added. “Now, there’s enormous consequences for violating that for the service providers.” If TikTok is removed by app store operators, that means new users won’t be able to download it. For existing users who already have the app on their phones, it won’t disappear, but because they won’t be able to update it via the app stores, it likely will eventually become buggy and riddled with security vulnerabilities. But even if the court upholds the ban, there remains considerable uncertainty around the app’s accessibility in the Trump administration. Trump has said he wants to save TikTok and the law gives him wide latitude on enforcement. “It is possible that come January 20th, 21st, 22nd, we might be in a different world,” Francisco said. Prelogar wouldn’t say whether Trump could extend the deadline after it’s already passed. “When push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect,” Prelogar said, “it might be just the jolt that Congress expected the company would need to actually move forward with the divestiture process.” The justices could not escape that Trump, though he has not been sworn in yet, took the eyebrow-raising step of filing a brief that urged the court to temporarily pause the ban’s January 19 implementation to give him time, as president, to negotiate a deal with TikTok. Alito, a conservative who has often battled with Prelgoar, asked the solicitor general about whether the court had the authority impose a so-called administrative stay on the law – a move that would effectively grant what Trump was seeking. Prelogar said that the court certainly had that power if it needed more time to decide the case, but she noted it had been fully briefed and now argued. The earlier exchange about Trump’s ability to not enforce the ban prompted questions from Kavanaugh about whether TikTok could rely on any non-enforcement assurance from the president-elect when deciding its next moves. As the solicitor general’s presentation was winding down, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor returned to that idea with a warning. “I am a little concerned that a suggestion that the president-elect or anyone else would not enforce the law, when a law is in effect and is prohibitive of certain action, that a company would choose to ignore enforcement on any assurance, other than a change in that law,” she said, while stressing that the company would, in that scenario, be violating the law. “Whatever the new president does doesn’t change that reality for these companies,” she said.

"Grammys and Oscars to proceed amid LA fires, but will put the spotlight on first responders",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/entertainment/oscars-grammys-award-season-la-wildfires/index.html,"As they say in Hollywood, the show must go on. On Monday, it was announced that both the Grammys and Oscars would proceed as planned on February 2 and March 2, respectively, answering a question that has been debated behind the scenes by decision makers tasked with figuring out how to proceed with award season as Los Angeles grapples with devastating wildfires. Some stars, like Jean Smart and Patricia Arquette, have called for award shows to be cancelled or re-focused as charitable telethons to raise funds for the fires. Award season – the Golden Globes, Grammys, SAG Awards, Oscars and more – is a glitzy time in Hollywood. Watching well-paid stars take the stage to collect awards while thousands of LA families are displaced and have lost their homes runs the risk of being tone deaf, but economically, these shows also provide income for thousands of entertainment workers from caterers to drivers to lighting professionals who are integral to the industry. The Grammys are the first show to announce they will proceed amid the wildfires, but the show will be reimagined to put the spotlight on first responders and also will include a charitable component. “In challenging times, music has the power to heal, comfort, and unite like nothing else,” Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. and chair of the board of Trustees Tammy Hurt said in a letter to Recording Academy members on Monday. “The Grammys will not only honor the artistry and achievements of our music community but also serve as a platform to amplify the spirit of resilience that defines this great city of Los Angeles.” The letter said that the show will proceed as planned in close coordination with local authorities to “ensure public safety and responsible use of area resources,” and that the ceremony will “carry a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.” Last week, the Recording Academy and its charitable arm, MusiCares, launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with an initial $1 million donation to support music creatives and professionals. Now, with additional contributions, the find has distributed more than $2 million in emergency aid and will continue its ongoing efforts. The Grammys are the next major televised award show to air on February 2. The Critics Choice Awards on E! were set to be hosted by Chelsea Handler on January 12 in Santa Monica – an area close to the Palisades fire – but were postponed last week. They are currently set to take place at the end of January. The Oscars has a longer timeline to determine next steps. The show is currently set to proceed on March 2, the Academy announced on Monday. Oscars voting has also now been extended through January 17, and the nominations announcement has been rescheduled for January 23 and will be held virtually instead of in-person. (Last week, the Academy had already pushed back the voting window and nominations.) The Oscars nominees luncheon, where nominees are feted, has been cancelled this year. “We are all devastated by the impact of the fires and the profound losses experienced by so many in our community. The Academy has always been a unifying force within the film industry, and we are committed to standing together in the face of hardship,” Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang, said in a letter to members on Monday. “Our members always share how important it is for us to come together as a community, and we are determined to use this opportunity to celebrate our resilient and compassionate industry,” the letter added. “We also look forward to honoring our frontline workers who have aided with the fires, recognizing those impacted, and encouraging people to join the Academy in supporting the relief efforts.” As CNN reported last week, many key award season events have been postponed. The annual AFI Awards luncheon, which was set to be held on January 10, will be rescheduled, and the annual BAFTA Tea Party was cancelled. Over the weekend, the Producers Guild Awards postponed their nominations announcement for the second time “out of care and concern for those being affected by the fires.” And on Monday, the Writers Guild Awards postponed their nominations “until further notice” due to the ongoing fires, the organization said in a statement to CNN. The Screen Actors Guild Awards are scheduled for February 23. Last week, the actors’ union donated $1 million to the SAG-AFTRA Foundation for fire relief."
Heidi Montag’s music tops iTunes charts after ‘Hills’ alum loses home in LA wildfire,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/entertainment/heidi-montag-itunes-wildfire/index.html,"Days after “The Hills” alums Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt lost their home in the Palisades Fire, Montag’s followers are showing up to support her by streaming her music. Montag’s 2010 song and album “Superficial” claimed the No. 1 spot on iTunes’ charts Monday, with Bad Bunny’s DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS album trailing Montag in the No. 2 spot. “Thank you so much to everyone who’s making my song number one itunes, number one in several different countries,” Montag said in a video posted to her Instagram story Monday. “Thank you, thank you, thank you for going harder for us, for our family. God bless you all.” The milestone comes after Pratt had been asking supporters on his TikTok page to help them earn money by streaming Montag’s track, and it seems their call was heeded. “Everyone made this happen!” Pratt celebrated on his Instagram page Monday. “You have no idea how much this means. Thank you. Keep streaming it, keep buying it.” The couple, who became ubiquitous with pop culture of the aughts, rose to fame on the Southern California-based reality show “The Hills.” They have been documenting their experience over the past week as they were evacuated from their home, later learning that it has been destroyed in the deadly wildfire. Pratt said his parents’ home also burned in the fire. High winds have propelled multiple ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles County, including the Palisades Fire on LA’s West side and the Eaton Fire, which is on LA’s East side in the neighborhood of Altadena. At least 24 people have died and dozens are still missing, authorities said. The coastal Palisades Fire is considered the most destructive ever in LA County. It is over 23,000 acres and was at least 14% contained as of Monday afternoon, according to Cal Fire. Officials said on Sunday that while progress has been made, the fire threat will remain “very high” as dangerous Santa Ana winds return this week."
"Pay a song for me: ‘Mr. Tambourine Man’ lyrics among Bob Dylan song drafts, artworks and photos to go on sale",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/entertainment/bob-dylan-tambourine-man-auction-aronowitz-intl/index.html,"A spectacular haul of Bob Dylan memorabilia, including early drafts of the singer and songwriter’s number 1 hit “Mr. Tambourine Man” and an original oil painting, will soon go under the hammer. Fans and collectors alike will be able to bid for 50 “extraordinary artifacts” from the musician’s life and career, with some items expected to fetch up to $600,000, according to Julien’s Auctions, which is selling the items. Others are valued at around $100. The items being sold form part of the personal collection of journalist Al Aronowitz, commonly known as the “godfather of rock journalism,” who became friends with many of the stars he reported on, including Dylan, the auction house said. Among the items are multiple pieces of original art, including a signed oil painting from 1968, and an analogue disc of the singer’s 2021 re-recording of “The Times They Are A-Changin,” one of his most famous songs which was released in 1964. A promotional leaflet for Dylan’s first major solo concert in 1963 at Town Hall in New York City and multiple vintage photos of the singer are also for sale. Perhaps the most eye-catching listing however is three drafts of “Mr. Tambourine Man” – the first Bob Dylan composition to get to number 1 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Dylan perfected the lyrics while staying at the Aronowitz family home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, while listening to Marvin Gaye’s “Can I Get A Witness” on repeat, according to the auction house, which added that the pages are estimated to sell for between $400,000 and $600,000. In an article written by Aronowitz – an original copy of which is also up for sale – the journalist recalls Dylan writing the lyrics in his home. Aronowitz said that Dylan wrote the song on a portable typewriter in a swirl of cigarette smoke, “his bony, long-nailed fingers tapping the words out on my stolen, canary-colored Saturday Evening Post copy paper.” Later, Aronowitz said that he found “a waste basket full of crumpled false starts,” according to excerpts of the article posted on the auction house website. “I took the crumpled sheets, smoothed them out, read the crazy leaping lines, smiled to myself at the leaps that never landed and then put the sheets into a file folder.” The auction house added that “the pages show substantial changes from the first draft to the third draft, which is close to the final version of the song, although it still has significant variations from the final lyrics.” “Don’t miss your chance to own a piece of history,” it said. Aronowitz’s son, Myles, said his father, who died in 2005, was “much more than a journalist, he understood what these artists were trying to do.” “The collection represents my father’s instinctive ability to identify and connect with greatness. Each item is evidence of this, and how with his magic, he literally brought you into the room,” he said in a statement. Singer Judy Collins previously said that Dylan wrote the song at the house of impresario Albert Grossman. “I heard this voice coming up the stairs and it was Dylan writing ‘Tambourine Man,’” she told the Strange Brew Podcast in 2023. “So, I got my robe on, I went downstairs and I sat for two hours in front of this blue door behind which Dylan was writing Tambourine Man.” The auction, titled “Celebrating Bob Dylan: The Al Aronowitz Archive, T Bone Burnett, & More,” is taking place at the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee on January 18. The sale coincides with James Mangold’s Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown” hitting cinemas across the world. Starring Timothée Chalamet as Dylan, the film follows the musician’s spectacular rise from his arrival in New York at age 19 to become one of the most influential singers and songwriters of all time. In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for “having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” He has sold more than 125 million records during his career."
Will Ferrell’s reason for dressing up as Buddy the Elf will shock no one: ‘Occasionally I just like to do weird things’,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/entertainment/will-ferrell-buddy-the-elf-reason/index.html,"Christmas might be over, but we’re still thinking about that moment from long-ago December when Will Ferrell inexplicably dressed up as one of his most iconic characters. Now he’s explaining why he did. On Friday’s episode of the “New Heights” podcast with brothers Travis and Jason Kelce, Ferrell discussed his thinking behind his decision to dress up as Buddy – the usually chipper elf from his now-classic 2003 holiday film “Elf” – at an LA Kings hockey game at Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena on December 29. “I get these weird ideas every now and then,” he told the Kelce brothers, later adding, “I told my wife, ‘Over the break, it would be funny if I just got a Buddy the Elf costume and didn’t shave for like a week, and I’m just sitting there with a candy cigarette and I’m just gonna sit there for a period and see how people react.’ And that was it.” Ferrell clearly committed to the stunt, as pictures from the game display him scowling and sporting a five o’clock shadow, drinking a beer and ‘smoking’ a faux cigarette. “Buddy the Elf got laid off, I think, from the North Pole,” Ferrell said on the podcast this week of his motivation for Buddy’s downtrodden vibe, adding, “He’s having a pull from his beer, smoking a cig.” “Elf” was directed by Marvel and “Star Wars” maestro Jon Favreau and starred Ferrell, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenbergen and Peter Dinklage, along with the late James Cann, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart. The film became an instant holiday classic, and follows Buddy, who was raised among Santa’s elves in the North Pole, as he searches for his real father in New York City. The funnyman wasn’t expecting the reaction he got from his “Elf”-related lark. “The reaction was insane!” Ferrell said. “Like, ‘What is he doing? Is he promoting something?’ But occasionally I just like to do weird things like that just to stir it up.” Keep stirring, Buddy. CNN’s Alli Rosenbloom contributed to this report."
Dave Coulier says chemotherapy for his cancer treatment is like ‘a roller coaster ride’,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/entertainment/dave-coulier-chemotherapy-cancer-roller-coaster/index.html,"Dave Coulier is discussing his experience fighting cancer. On the latest episode of the “Full House Rewind” podcast, the “Fuller House” star, 65, shared more about the side effects of his treatment for stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer. “It’s been kind of a roller coaster ride. Different effects,” he said. “And people who are watching the show or listening to the show, who have been here before, you know that it’s a roller coaster, because the side effects have side effects, and then you take a drug to counteract that and this and that.” He added that “it’s this constant cocktail where your body is in fight or flight mode, and you’re just trying to adjust to, like, ‘Okay, how am I adjusting to steroids? How am I adjusting to the chemo cocktail? And then, how am I adjusting to all these other things?’” Coulier continued to say that his body is “in a fight. It’s a little bit of an internal battle.” According to the American Cancer Society, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is one of the most common cancers in the US, accounting for about 4% of all cancers. The actor initially shared the news of his diagnosis in November, during an interview on “Today.” He told the show’s co-anchor Hoda Kotb at the time that he had been diagnosed five weeks prior. Coulier said he has “B cell lymphoma,” which he described as “aggressive.” “The onset of this growing lymphoma in my groin area was very quick so I said ‘Something’s not right, I have a golf ball down here,’” he told Kotb. “And so we biopsed it, we took it out, and they said ‘You know, we wish we had better news for you, but you have B cell lymphoma, we need to get you into chemotherapy right away.’” This week, Coulier told his former “Fuller House” costar Marla Sokoloff on the podcast that opening up about his journey has been a positive, largely because it has helped to spread awareness about cancer detection and treatment. “I have heard from so many people, Marla, who have been affected by cancer in their lives. And, you know, the words of encouragement have, I think, really helped people. So that, to me, is worth the journey of all of this,” he shared. “If I have to feel a little out of sorts for a few months, then, then so be it,” Coulier also said. “But just being able to alert people that it’s okay to get a colonoscopy, or early screenings, or a mammogram, it’s really worth it.” “Early detection means everything, and for so many people it can save your life, which is remarkable.” CNN’s Lisa Respers France contributed to this report."
"Allison Holker responds to backlash over revelations about her late husband, Stephen ‘tWitch’ Boss",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/entertainment/allison-holker-twitch-backlash/index.html,"Allison Holker has spoken out amid criticism over her decision to share personal details about her late husband Stephen “tWitch” Boss in her forthcoming memoir. “To fans of Stephen and our family and friends, I want to be clear that my only intention in writing the book is to share my own story as well as part of my life with Stephen to help other people,” she wrote in an Instagram story posted on Wednesday. “Just like you, I never really knew what happened, and even as I am trying to put the pieces together I will never really know.” Boss, the amiable DJ for “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and dancer who rose to fame on “So You Think You Can Dance,” died in December 2022 by suicide at age 40. He and Holker had celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary just days prior. Holker, who is also a dancer, told People magazine in a recently published exclusive interview that while preparing for her husband’s funeral, she discovered a “cornucopia” of drugs – including mushrooms, pills and “other substances I had to look up on my phone” hidden away among her late husband’s personal items. “I was with one of my really dear friends, and we were cleaning out the closet and picking out an outfit for him for the funeral,” she said. “It was a really triggering moment for me because there were a lot of things I discovered in our closet that I did not know existed. It was very alarming to me to learn that there was so much happening that I had no clue (about).” “It was a really scary moment in my life to figure that out, but it also helped me process that he was going through so much and he was hiding so much, and there must have been a lot of shame in that,” she added. Boss’s mother, Connie Boss Alexander, posted a statement on Instagram on Thursday, writing “Our family is absolutely appalled by the misleading and hurtful claims made about my son, Stephen Boss.” “The recent publications spreading untruths about Stephen have crossed every line of decency. As his mother, I will not let these accusations go unanswered,” she wrote. “We will not stand by while his name and legacy are tarnished. He doesn’t deserve this, and the kids don’t deserve this.” His mother wrote that she has “remained quiet and away from the public eye to protect my family” for the past two years. “My primary focus has been on healing and attempting to remain connected to my grandchildren,” she added. “But when I read these dreadful claims about my baby, our beloved Stephen, I realized I could not stay silent any longer. Our family will ensure his name and memory are protected, and we are committed to defending his honor.” In the note posted on her Instagram story, Holker wrote: “If you decide to read the book, hopefully you’ll see my intention is to celebrate the love and life I shaered with Stephen and our three beautiful children, and also the more complex aspects of both of our lives.” “I hope that by sharing our full story maybe I can help someone else who might see themselves or a loved one in Stephen,” she wrote. “In sharing I hope that maybe they can catch some of the red flags that I missed before it’s too late.” Holker added that all of her proceeds from the book are “going to fund the mental health focused foundation I started in Stephen’s honor, Move with Kindness.” “My hope is that we don’t need to lose another husband, brother, father or friend to suicide,” Holker wrote. Boss and his wife were all-star dancers on Season 7 of “So You Think You Can Dance” in 2010 and connected romantically. “We shared a dance at the wrap party of that season of ‘So You Think You Can Dance’ and we have been together ever since,” Boss told People months before his death. Holker’s new memoir titled, “This Far,” is out February 4."
Billy Crystal and more celebrities impacted by ongoing Los Angeles wildfires,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/entertainment/celebrities-impacted-wildfires-los-angeles/index.html,"As at least four wildfires rage around Los Angeles, numerous members of the Hollywood community have been impacted, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore, Jeff Bridges, Anna Faris and Ricki Lake. In statement to CNN on Wednesday, Crystal said, “Words cannot describe the enormity of the devastation we are witnessing and experiencing. We ache for our friends and neighbors who have also lost their homes and businesses in this tragedy.” “Janice and I lived in our home since 1979. We raised our children and grandchildren here. Every inch of our house was filled with love. Beautiful memories that can’t be taken away,” he added. “We are heartbroken of course but with the love of our children and friends we will get through this. We pray for the safety of the fire fighters and first responders. The Pacific Palisades is a resilient community of amazing people and we know in time it will rise again. It is our home.” The family beach home belonging to Oscar-winning actor Bridges was also destroyed by fire. He and his loved ones are safe, according to his representative. Actor and former talk show host Lake shared on her Instagram page Wednesday that she lost her “dream home” in the fires, writing, “It’s all gone.” “It was our heaven on earth. The place where we planned to grow old together. We never took our heavenly spot on the bluff overlooking our beloved malibu for granted, not even for one second,” she wrote. Lake added that she is grieving the “immeasurable” loss of her home, where she and her husband wed three years ago. Paris Hilton said she learned that her Malibu home was lost while watching it burn on live TV, writing on her Instagram page the image is something “no one should ever have to experience.” “This home was where we built so many precious memories. It’s where Phoenix took his first steps and where we dreamed of building a lifetime of memories with London,” she wrote. “While the loss is overwhelming, I’m holding onto gratitude that my family is safe. My heart and prayers are going out to every family affected by these fires.” Celebrity chef Sandra Lee also said she lost her house due to the disaster. “I cried all night and thought about every room, nook, and cranny. It was perfection and now it’s just Ash,” Lee wrote in a post shared on Instagram. “Please keep our community, the firefighters and the first responders in your prayers. This is not over-not even close.” Actors James Woods and Steve Guttenberg spoke to CNN Wednesday morning about their experiences navigating the fires in their neighborhoods. Mandy Moore, who resides near the Eaton Fire, posted an update on her Instagram story on Tuesday night that she and her family of five had evacuated to safety. On Wednesday, Moore shared another update mourning the destruction of her neighborhood. “Honestly, I’m in shock and feeling numb for all so many have lost, including my family. My children’s school is gone. Our favorite restaurants, leveled,” Moore wrote on her Instagram page Wednesday. “So many friends and loved ones have lost everything too. Our community is broken but we will be here to rebuild together.” Reality stars Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag’s home burned in the Palisades fire, according to Pratt, who posted a photo of their children’s room burning on his Instagram page Wednesday. Both their house and Pratt’s parents’ house burned in the fire, he wrote. Faris was also reportedly impacted by the Palisades Fire. A representative told CNN on Wednesday that “Anna and her family are safe and very grateful.” Several massive fires in Los Angeles County, fueled by excessive wind, have killed at least two people and left others with “significant injuries.” The two civilians died in the Eaton Fire, burning in East Los Angeles near Altadena and Pasadena, county Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said Wednesday morning. The Palisades Fire, burning in LA’s westside near Malibu and Santa Monica, has already destroyed at least 1,000 structures. It is the most destructive to ever occur in Los Angeles County, according to CalFire data. The fires are 0% contained as emergency workers struggle to battle fast-moving blazes, and tens of thousands more people are under evacuation orders across LA County. Several Hollywood events were also postponed due to the fires, including the Critics Choice Awards. Originally set to be held this Sunday in Santa Monica, the awards show has been postponed to January 26, Critics Choice Awards CEO Joey Berlin in a statement Wednesday."
"Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, pushes Netflix series debut due to ‘devastating’ LA wildfires",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/entertainment/meghan-markle-netflix-series-wildfires/index.html,"“With Love, Meghan,” the Netflix lifestyle series produced by and starring Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, that is set to be a sun-soaked tribute to breezy Southern California living, will not premiere this month as planned as the area contends with deadly wildfires that have devastated the region, she said in a statement. “I’m thankful to my partners at Netflix for supporting me in delaying the launch, as we focus on the needs of those impacted by the wildfires in my home state of California,” Markle said in a statement on Sunday. The series will now debut on March 4. It was originally scheduled to begin streaming on January 15. “With Love, Meghan,” was filmed in Montecito, California and showcases Markle sharing “personal tips and tricks, embracing playfulness over perfection and highlights how easy it can be to create beauty, even in the unexpected,” according to a Netflix description of the series. Markle and her husband Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, have been aiding the relief efforts around Los Angeles. On Friday, they made an appearance at the Pasadena Convention Center, where they met with first responders and people affected by the deadly wildfires, according to footage captured by Fox 11.

"Leslie Charleson, ‘General Hospital’s’ Dr. Monica Quartermaine, dies at 79",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/entertainment/leslie-charleson-general-hospital-dead/index.html,"Leslie Charleson, who played popular character Dr. Monica Quartermaine for almost 50 years on “General Hospital,” has died, the program’s executive producer announced on Sunday. She was 79. “It is with a heavy heart that I announce the passing of my dear friend and colleague, Leslie Charleson. Her enduring legacy has spanned nearly 50 years on General Hospital alone and, just as Monica was the heart of the Quartermaines, Leslie was a beloved matriarch of the entire cast and crew,” “General Hospital” producer Frank Valentini wrote. “I will miss our daily chats, her quick wit and incredible presence on set. On behalf of everyone at General Hospital, my heartfelt sympathy goes out to her loved ones during this difficult time.” Charleson started the role in 1977 and continued until her passing. Born in Kansas City, Missouri, she began acting as a child, starting her television career as a regular on another ABC daytime series titled “A Time for Us,” according to Soap Central After a stint on “As the World Turns,” Charleson also spent two-and-a-half years on another CBS soap, “Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,” which earned her her first Emmy nomination for the role of Iris Donelly Garrison. The actress also appeared in several commercials. “Of all the numerous commercials Leslie has done, she credits those for Pearl Drops with getting her a part in the movie ‘Day of the Dolphin,’ directed by Mike Nichols and co-starring George C. Scott,” her bio on Soap Central stated. “She followed this with a performance in the David Merrick play, one-night stand, co-starring Tony Curtis.” Charleson later guest-starred in multiple popular television shows, including “Adam 12,” “Barnaby Jones,” “Marcus Welby, M.D.,” “Ironside,” “Kung Fu,” and “The Rockford Files.” “It was on Happy Days that Leslie gave Ron Howard his first on-screen kiss,” her bio states. “She also co-starred with Deidre Hall in the television movie, ‘Woman on the Ledge,’ and made a guest appearance on ‘Diagnosis Murder’ and ‘Dharma & Greg.’” But it was Charleson’s role on “General Hospital” that garnered her the most fame and satisfaction. She joined the show in 1977, taking over the role from Patsy Rahn, who originated it. Charleson talked about a meaningful breast cancer storyline for her character in a 2020 interview. “At the time, ‘General Hospital’ had a strong female administration with a female executive producer and head writer, and together, each one of us had been touched by breast cancer in our own lives,” she said. “Dealing with a real-life issue that afflicts so many women and their families and being able to show the struggle and issues they face, was something I am so proud of. It was exhausting and incredibly difficult work, but the response to the storyline was truly humbling.” She became a spokesperson for breast cancer, cystic fibrosis, and AIDS-related charities. The star was as devoted to her fan base as they were to her. “‘General Hospital’s’ fans are fiercely loyal, and I think, because these characters appear in their homes each weekday, year after year, they truly feel a connection to us personally,” she said in the interview. “I once had a fan come up to me to introduce me to her friend, before she realized that I hadn’t actually met her before either!” Charleson was appearing on the soap as a recurring character since 2010."
"Sam Moore, who sang ‘Soul Man’ in Sam & Dave duo, dies at 89",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/entertainment/sam-moore-death/index.html,"Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as “Soul Man” and “Hold On, I’m Comin,’” has died. He was 89. Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available. Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Sam & Dave partner Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the “call and response” of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music’s most enduring hits, which also included “You Don’t Know Like I Know,” “When Something is Wrong With My Baby” and “I Thank You.” Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music’s most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called “Play it, Steve” midway through “Soul Man.” Like many ’60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But “Soul Man” hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the “Saturday Night Live” stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers. In 2008, the movie “Soul Men” depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close. He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia. Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993. Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly. “Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?” Moore said then. “If you’re making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don’t give me cornbread and tell me it’s biscuits.” Moore wrote the song “Dole Man,” modeled on “Soul Man,” for Republican Bob Dole’s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama’s campaign used the song “Hold On, I’m Comin’.” Moore was born October 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church. He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn’t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label’s Stax subsidiary in Memphis. Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band’s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit. He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction that he credited with saving his life. “I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,” during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators. “That’s funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,” he said. “But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I’m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.” Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama. Moore is survived by his wife, Joyce, daughter and two grandchildren."
Celebrities among the many who have lost homes due to LA wildfires,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/entertainment/mel-gibson-celebrity-homes-la-fires/index.html,"Mel Gibson’s home in Malibu was destroyed by the Los Angeles wildfires while he was away recording a podcast with Joe Rogan in Austin, Texas, Gibson has revealed. The Oscar-winning actor and director shared the news during a telephone interview with NewsNation’s “Elizabeth Vargas Reports.” Gibson said he was doing OK in the wake of the destruction. “Obviously, it’s kind of devastating. It’s emotional,” he said. “You live there for a long time, and you had all your stuff. You remember [comedian] George Carlin talking about your stuff? I had my stuff there, and it’s all like, I’ve been relieved from the burden of my stuff because it’s all in cinders.” Gibson said he was “ill at ease” during the podcast with Rogan because he was aware that his neighborhood was on fire. “When I got home, sure enough, [the house] wasn’t there,” he told Vargas. “I went home and I said to myself, ‘Well at least I haven’t got any of those pesky plumbing problems anymore.’” He said he and his girlfriend had evacuated, but she stayed in Calfornia while he went to Texas to do the podcast. “I have never seen a place so perfectly burned,” Gibson said of his destroyed home. “You could put it in an urn.” Other celebrities, including Milo Ventimiglia, Mandy Moore, Billy Crystal, Jeff Bridges, Paris Hilton, Ricki Lake and Miles Teller’s wife Keleigh have opened up about losing their homes. Moore shared an update on Instagram Thursday, writing that she was able to visit her Altadena home and “bear witness to all this loss,” including in the post three photos of what’s left of her residence. “Miraculously, the main part of our house is still standing. For now. It’s not livable but mostly intact,” Moore wrote. She added that they lost their garage and back house to the fire. In statement to CNN on Wednesday, Crystal said, “Words cannot describe the enormity of the devastation we are witnessing and experiencing. We ache for our friends and neighbors who have also lost their homes and businesses in this tragedy.” “Janice and I lived in our home since 1979. We raised our children and grandchildren here. Every inch of our house was filled with love. Beautiful memories that can’t be taken away,” he added. “We are heartbroken of course but with the love of our children and friends we will get through this. We pray for the safety of the fire fighters and first responders. The Pacific Palisades is a resilient community of amazing people and we know in time it will rise again. It is our home.” The family beach home belonging to Oscar-winning actor Bridges was also destroyed by fire. He and his loved ones are safe, according to his representative. Actor and former talk show host Lake shared on her Instagram page Wednesday that she lost her “dream home” in the fires, writing, “It’s all gone.” “It was our heaven on earth. The place where we planned to grow old together. We never took our heavenly spot on the bluff overlooking our beloved malibu for granted, not even for one second,” she wrote. Lake added that she is grieving the “immeasurable” loss of her home, where she and her husband wed three years ago."

The actress and singer shared an update to her Instagram on Thursday, writing that she was able to visit her home and “bear witness to all this loss,” including in the post three photos of what’s left of her Altadena residence. “Miraculously, the main part of our house is still standing.

We love this community and will do everything we can to help rebuild and support.” The photos that Moore shared show her husband Taylor Goldsmith, who is a musician in the band Dawes, walking through a field of debris on what appears to be their lawn. Some of the debris piles looked like they were still producing smoke. Moore has shared further updates on her Instagram page since the Altadena-based fire, which caused her and her family to evacuate earlier this week, broke out. California Gov. Gavin Newsom told CNN that at least five people have died as several wildfires blaze across Los Angeles County and remain mostly uncontained. The fast-moving Eaton Fire has ballooned to more than 10,000 acres and is now threatening about 13,000 buildings. The Palisades Fire continues scorching the seaside area between Malibu and Santa Monica. It has exploded to more than 17,000 acres with zero containment and has destroyed at least 1,000 structures. It is the most destructive fire ever in Los Angeles County."
Demi Moore wins her first award for acting: ‘I’m just in shock right now’,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/05/entertainment/demi-moore-golden-globe-speech/index.html,"Demi Moore is now a first-time Golden Globe winner. On Sunday, Moore won for best female actor in a film — musical or comedy for her performance in “The Substance.” “I really wasn’t expecting that. I’m just in shock right now,” Moore said when she took the stage. “I’ve been doing this a long time, like over 45 years, and this is the first time I’ve ever won anything as an actor and I’m just so humbled and so grateful.” Moore, 62, recalled an exchange with a movie producer about 30 years ago who called her a “popcorn actress.” “At that time, I made that mean that this wasn’t something that I was allowed to have,” she said of her win. “And I bought in and I believed that and that corroded me over time to the point where I thought a few years ago that maybe this was it. Maybe I was complete, maybe I’ve done what I was supposed to do.” She said that the script for “The Substance” came to her while she was in “this low point” of her life. “(Then) I had this magical, bold, courageous, out of the box, absolutely bonkers script come across my desk called ‘The Substance,’ and the universe told me that you’re not done,” Moore continued. Moore’s family and friends celebrated her win and shared a video of their enthusiastic reaction on Instagram, writing “She did it!” “The Substance” is a feminist fable with a dark warning about the pitfalls of blindly chasing youth, written and directed by Coralie Fargeat of France. “I’ll just leave you with one thing that I think this movie is imparting,” Moore said of the film. “In those moments, when we don’t think we’re smart enough, or pretty enough, or skinny enough, or successful enough, or basically just not enough: I had a woman say to me, ‘Just know, you will never be enough, but you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.”"
Pamela Anderson says she was confronted on plane by angry passenger who thought she was someone else,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/entertainment/pamela-anderson-dixie-chicks-scli-intl/index.html,"Pamela Anderson has recounted how she was confronted on board a flight after being mistaken for a member of the country band The Chicks, formerly known as the Dixie Chicks. Speaking about her new movie, “The Last Showgirl,” on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast Tuesday, Anderson told host Josh Horowitz that she was targeted by a fellow passenger. “This one time, I was on a flight and this guy came up to me and said, ‘Do you know what this country’s done for you?’” the former “Baywatch” star said. “And I was like, ‘Oh, my God. What have I done?’ I was like, ‘Oh god.’ I looked back and he was (angry). Then this stewardess had to, like, handcuff him to the chair because he was trying to attack me.” “Yeah. Ended up he thought I was a Dixie Chick. Remember that whole Dixie Chick thing?” Anderson said, referring to virulent criticism of the band after its members spoke out against the United States’ invasion of Iraq in 2003. “I almost got killed on a plane,” said Anderson. “I was scared to fly after that, a little bit.” The Chicks are one of the best-selling female bands and country groups in music history. The band has won 13 Grammys, 10 CMA awards and eight ACM awards. In 2003, before the invasion of Iraq, lead singer Natalie Maines said at a concert that the group, which got its start in Dallas, did not endorse the war and were “ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas.” Their remarks about then-President George W. Bush triggered boycotts and backlash from fans, resulting in country stations across the country pulling the group’s music from the radio. At the time, in March 2003, CNN reported that “station managers said their decisions were prompted by calls from irate listeners who thought criticism of the president was unpatriotic.”"
Lisa Kudrow recently found a note Matthew Perry left for her in a ‘Friends’ prop,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/entertainment/lisa-kudrow-matthew-perry-note-friends-intl-scli/index.html,"Lisa Kudrow has revealed that she recently found a note that Matthew Perry left inside a “Friends” prop for her 20 years ago. The actress told “The Drew Barrymore Show” on Tuesday that the cookie jar from the set of the hit show had been gifted to her by Perry at the end of their final episode, which aired in 2004. “I had recently found the note that he had in it (the jar) for me,” Kudrow said. “I hadn’t opened it up or looked inside of it,” she said. “But yeah, he did. He had a note in there and I forgot about it.” Though Kudrow did not divulge what was in the note, she echoed host Barrymore, who gave her a hug and said: “Timing is everything.” Kudrow mentioned discovering the note after being asked by Barrymore if she had ever taken anything from set. She said she had, but refused to say what it was. “I’m too afraid to tell you what,” said Kudrow of her secret keepsake. “I can’t say… I’m afraid… someone will come get it.” Perry, who died age 54 in his Pacific Palisades home in October 2023, was best known for his role as Chandler Bing on “Friends,” starring alongside Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc. Perry died because of “acute effects of ketamine” and subsequent drowning, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office autopsy report. He’d previously detailed his decades-long struggles with drugs. In a tribute following his death, Kudrow said: “Thank you for making me laugh so hard at something you said, that my muscles ached, and tears poured down my face EVERY DAY.” “Thank you for your open heart in a six way relationship that required compromise. And a lot of ‘talking.’ Thank you for showing up at work when you weren’t well and then, being completely brilliant. Thank you for the best 10 years a person gets to have,” Kudrow’s Instagram post continued."
Viola Davis shares her powerful ‘testimony’ in her Cecil B. DeMille Award acceptance speech,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/06/entertainment/viola-davis-golden-globes-cecil-b-demille-award/index.html,"Viola Davis shared her journey from poverty to being an EGOT winner, leaning into the “magic” that helped her earn the Cecil B. DeMille Award ahead of Sunday’s Golden Globes. The acclaimed actress said she felt like “someone just set me on fire” when she took to the stage to accept award, which honors those who have made “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.” She thanked her friend and presenter, Meryl Streep, whom she called “a great broad” before launching into her speech. “This is my testimony,” she said. “I think I decided to be an actor because acting was just a cosmic carrot for a much higher journey. A journey into finding me, finding a sense of belonging, finding my worth.” Davis said she saw life as “a big, fat f**king dude” who had “endless amounts of gold that is just falling down randomly.” Gold she saw as blessing to some people “who don’t deserve it” and didn’t work for it and others who actually worked for it. Such a blessed life was not how Davis started. “I was born into a life that just simply did not make sense. I didn’t fit in. I was born into abject poverty. I was mischievous. I was imaginative,” she said. “I was rambunctious. I was poor going up in a house with alcoholism and infested with rats everywhere.” As if such poverty wasn’t bad enough, Davis said, “And on top of all that, all anyone ever said was that I wasn’t pretty.” “By the way, what the hell is pretty?,” she asked. “I wasn’t pretty. I just wanted be somebody.” The now 59-year-old actress was able to escape her circumstances because of “magic.” “And you know what my magic was? That I could teleport,” she said. “That I can take myself out of this worthless world and relieve myself of it at times.” Davis admitted that early in her career she “took a lot of jobs because of the money.” “Because sometimes for a dark-skinned Black woman with a wide nose and big lips, that’s all there is out there,” she said. “If I waited for a role that was written for me, well-crafted, I wouldn’t be standing up here. So I took it for the money.” The “How To Get Away With Murder” star noted that she did not find “any nobility in poverty,” which for her included being a child who wet the bed and went to school in urine soaked clothes. “They say that the only two people you owe anything to is your 6-year-old self and your 80-year-old self and 6-year-old Viola, sometimes I have to rely on to give me perspective of even this moment,” Davis said. “Otherwise, it’s too big for me to imagine only from bedwetting and poverty and despair and wrongness to this. And little Viola is squealing.” “Little Viola,” she noted, was “powerful.” “So little Viola is squealing. She’s standing behind me now and she’s pulling on my dress and she’s wearing the same red rubber boots as she wore rain or shine because they made her feel pretty,” Davis concluded her speech. “She’s squealing and she’s saying one thing. She says, ‘Make them hear this.’ And what she’s whispering is, ‘I told you I was a magician.’”"
Florence Pugh says her ‘Midsommar’ role left her ‘broken for a long while’,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/entertainment/florence-pugh-midsommar-role-intl-scli/index.html,"Florence Pugh is hesitant to play another role like the one she portrayed in 2019 horror “Midsommar,” saying she felt like she “abused” herself and was “broken for a long while afterwards.” In the movie, the British actress starred as Dani, a grieving graduate student who joins her boyfriend on a visit to rural Sweden to observe a festival that happens every 90 years during the summer solstice. Pagan rituals and cultish horrors soon begin to unfold in the seemingly friendly community in the Ari Aster-directed movie loosely inspired by the Scandinavian festival of midsummer. “Protecting myself is something I’ve had to learn how to do,” Pugh told the “Reign with Josh Smith” podcast. The actress, who stars alongside Andrew Garfield in the newly-released romantic drama “We Live in Time,” said on the podcast that some roles she has played require giving “too much” of herself and can leave her feeling “broken for a long while afterwards.” “Like when I did ‘Midsommar’… I definitely felt like I abused myself in the places that I got myself to go,” she said. “The nature of figuring these things out is you need to go, ‘Alright, well I can’t do that again cause that was too much.’” In an interview with The Sunday Times last month, Pugh said that, in order to enter the frame of mind needed for the role, she had to imagine family members in coffins and going to an open casket funeral for her siblings. “I was hyperventilating,” she told the British newspaper. “Over the years I’ve had to figure out how to not utterly destroy myself.” Although the process was gruelling, Pugh has previously praised her director, telling the New York Times in 2023 that Aster was “peculiar in the mad genius kind of way.” Despite the difficulties she faced during filming, Pugh said she was proud of her performance in the movie, which won praise from critics and was a box office hit. “I’m really proud of what I did and I’m proud of what came out of me, so I don’t regret it,” she said."

"‘Wicked’ will make its streaming debut on New Year’s Eve, with deleted and extended scenes",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/26/entertainment/wicked-streaming-release/index.html,"There’s no place like home… to watch the “Wicked” movie. Universal Pictures, the studio behind the hit film, announced on Thursday that “Wicked” will be available to buy or rent on December 31 on digital streaming platforms including Prime Video and Apple TV. The streaming release will also include a plethora of bonus content, including a sing-along version of the film, behind-the-scenes featurettes, commentary from director Jon M. Chu and the film’s stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, plus several deleted and extended scenes, according to a news release. Among the bonus content is a 40-minute behind-the-scenes featurette that “celebrates the film’s transformative on-screen magic,” and bonus clips that will give viewers a look at the special effects that brought the large-scale sets to life. “Wicked” stars Erivo, Grande, Jeff Goldblum, Bowen Yang, Peter Dinklage, Marissa Bode, “Bridgerton” star Jonathan Bailey and Oscar-winner Michelle Yeoh. The nearly three-hour-long epic is the first installment of Chu’s two-part cinematic adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical that recounts events in the magical land of Oz that occurred before Dorothy’s arrival. The musical, which opened on Broadway in 2003, was itself adapted from Gregory Maguire’s 1995 novel “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch.” The movie premiered in theaters on November 22 and has raked in over $580 million at the global box office to date, also nabbing the third highest-grossing opening weekend of 2024 behind “Deadpool & Wolverine” and “Inside Out 2.” “Wicked” has been nominated for four Golden Globes including best motion picture – musical or comedy, and recognition in lead and supporting acting categories for Erivo and Grande, respectively. The second installment will be titled “Wicked: For Good,” in a nod to one of the original musical’s popular songs, and will premiere in theaters on November 21, 2025."

Avicii’s life and death back in the spotlight with new documentary,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/02/entertainment/aviciis-life-death-documentary/index.html,"More than six years after his death at the age of 28, the life of the Grammy-nominated DJ and producer Avicii is being celebrated in a new documentary, “Avicii- I Am Tim” is now streaming on Netflix. Avicii, who was born Tim Bergling, narrates the film through archival footage. “Before Avicii, there was Tim,” reads the Netflix description of the project. “Through his own words, witness how a prodigious musical talent became one of the defining artists of his generation.” The film’s director, Henrik Burman, explained to Billboard why he told the story in Bergling’s own words. “When I determined that he’d be the one who’d narrate this story, I thought that maybe it was how I could be close to him,” Burman said. “Maybe that’s how I can meet him.” A longtime music journalist and musician in Sweden, Burman had the blessing of Bergling’s family and was fortunate to find a trove of interviews with Bergling over the course of his career to draw from. “He’d say things like, ‘If there’s a documentary, we need to talk about alcohol; we need to talk about the bad things in my life,’” Burman said. “I’ve been looking for clues like this — I’ve listened to Tim for hours and hours trying to understand him and put together the puzzle of who he was as a person and who Avicii was as this amazing artist.” Bergling died by suicide while on holiday in Muscat, Oman. The film explores his struggles with mental health and substance abuse, including journal entries from the Stockholm-born artist when he sought treatment. “Those days in hospital were the most anxiety and stress-free days I can remember in the past six years, those were my true vacations, as depressing as it might sound,” he wrote. The posthumous Avicii album “Tim” was released in 2019."

Zendaya and Tom Holland: A timeline of ‘Tomdaya’,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/entertainment/zendaya-tom-holland-relationship-timeline/index.html,"It’s no surprise that Zendaya and Tom Holland have not rushed to publicly confirm whether or not they may be engaged after speculation sparked at the Golden Globes. A seemingly massive diamond on Zendaya’s left ring finger at Sunday’s awards ceremony led to reports that Holland had privately popped the question to his “Spider-Man” costar over the holidays. CNN has reached out to representatives for both for comment. But the internet, that had years earlier dubbed them “Tomdaya,” was thrilled. Here’s a timeline of their relationship: The pair costarred in “Spider-Man:Homecoming,” with Holland playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Zendaya as his love interest Michelle or MJ. The two spun a web of speculation early on that they were romantically involved due to their chemistry during the film’s press tour. That wasn’t stemmed, in part, to a now-famous appearance they made on the show “Lip Sync Battle.” Zendaya dressed as Bruno Mars to perform his hit “24K Magic,” while Holland stole the show with both his dress and dance moves performing Rihanna’s “Umbrella.” Zendaya sought to shut down romance rumors when she told Variety “We are friends” and firmly told the publication, “No,” when asked if they were a love match. “He’s a great dude. He’s literally one of my best friends,” she said. “This past how many months we’ve had to do press tours together. There’s very few people that will understand what that’s like at 20 years old.” Fans weren’t convinced that the two weren’t a couple, especially after they filmed “Spider-Man: Far From Home” and Zendaya wished Holland a happy 23rd birthday on social media. “Happy birthday weirdo, thanks for being the wonderful person you are, we’re all very lucky to have you and your weirdness,” she wrote. Holland returned the favor on Zendaya’s special day, posting on social media, “The birthday girl…hope you’re having an amazing day!” The beans were spilled when the couple were photographed kissing in Holland’s car. Holland appeared to no longer feel the need for secrecy as that year he wished Zendaya a happy birthday using a photo showing them taking a selfie on the set of one of the Spider-Man films. “My MJ, have the happiest of birthdays,” he wrote in the caption. “Gimme a call when your up xxx.” Around the time “No Way Home” was released, Zendaya was posting her pride about her boyfriend. “My Spider-Man, I’m so proud of you, some things never change and good thing,” she wrote, alongside a photo of her in character and another which appeared to be of a young Holland also dressed as Spider-Man. The couple also went viral for new press tour moments, including critiquing each other’s kitchen habits. Zendaya spoke out after a prank on social media that falsely claimed she and Holland were expecting went viral. “See now, this is why I stay off Twitter,” she posted in response. “Just making stuff up for no reason…weekly.” A year later they went viral for their obvious excitement at attending Beyoncé’s Renaissance Tour stop in Warsaw, Poland. Zendaya took to her Instagram stories to deny rumors that she and Holland were engaged after fans and followers spotted a pearl ring on her hand. “I posted it for my hat. Not for the ring on my right finger, you guys” she said in a video responding to the speculation. “Seriously, you think that’s how I would drop the news? What?”"
Adrien Brody dedicates his Globe win for ‘The Brutalist’ to his immigrant ancestors,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/06/entertainment/adrien-brody-globe-speech/index.html,"“The Brutalist,” a film about a Jewish architect who survives the Holocaust and emigrates to the United States to achieve the American Dream, had a big night at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday. The movie, which stars Adrien Brody, was nominated in seven categories and won four Globes total on Sunday. Brody, who won for best actor in a motion picture drama, marking his first individual Globes win, dedicated the award to those who have faced struggles immigrating and to the “sacrifice” of his parents and extended family ancestors, some of whom fled war to come “to this great country.” Brody’s speech follows in full below: “Thank you to everyone in this room, Golden Globes voters, for this honor, I am deeply humbled by this. I have much to say. I’m going to try and be brief. At the core of ‘The Brutalist,’ it is really a story about the human capacity for creation, so I would be remiss to not acknowledge my fellow nominees. Daniel, Colman, Timmy, Sebastian, Sebastian, Ralph. You guys really just — you reached such heights with your work, and you are such inspirations to me. To my — God, Brady and Mona, I love you guys.Thank you for giving me wings. Thank you for allowing me to be a small part of building this triumph and monument to humanity and the arts. To my cast and crew, and everyone who has been a part of making this movie, this is a collaborative effort, and I share this with all of you. To my friends and team at CAA, A24, thank you for supporting me through this journey. To my mom and dad, who are here tonight. Oh, my goodness. You always hold me up. I often credit my mother for her influence on me as an artist, but Dad, you are the foundation of this family, and all this love that I received flows back to you. To my beautiful and amazing partner, Georgina. Your generosity of spirit, your own resilience your immense creativity, are a daily reminder of how to be. I would not be standing here before you if it wasn’t for you. There was a time not too long ago that I felt this may never be a moment afforded to me again, so thank you. You know, this story is really the character’s journey is very reminiscent of my mother’s and my ancestors’ journey of fleeing war and coming to this great country. I owe so much to my mother and my grandparents for their sacrifice, and although I do not know fully how to express all of the challenges that you have faced and experienced, and the many people who have struggled immigrating to this country, I hope that this work stands to lift you up a bit and to give you a voice. I’m so grateful. I will cherish this moment forever.”"

"2025 TV preview: A hotel stay in Thailand, monsters, aliens and more",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/30/entertainment/2025-tv-preview/index.html,"The new year is almost upon us, and – regardless of the endless watchlists of content we all have yet to tackle – with it comes a glut of showy new titles destined for our at-home screens of varying sizes. While many of the selections below are not new shows, the desire to revisit familiar and beloved characters and storylines to see where things go next is evidence of the great work accomplished by those who made these returning series. Below is a selection of just some of the most-anticipated entertainment set for the new calendar year on TV and streaming: After a fiendishly scary, engrossing and musical Season 4 way back in 2022, it’s time to return to Hawkins to revisit whatever’s lurking Upside Down – namely one Vecna. Like with “Euphoria” (which won’t be back until 2026), between the pandemic, Hollywood strikes, other cast commitments and more, a lot of time has passed since we last saw Eleven and her friends. Netflix has not yet specified a date for “Stranger Things” Season 5 – its final – to debut. Another highly anticipated returning show is “White Lotus,” from the mind of “Enlightened” craftsman Mike White. The first Hawaii-set season was a master class in how to portray strained, awkward racial tension and class relations, while 2022’s second season, set in Italy, was a bedroom farce that built to a viral crescendo, thanks to Emmy-winner Jennifer Coolidge’s gleefully clueless Tanya. The third go-round, taking place in Thailand, will welcome back Belinda (the excellent Natasha Rothwell) from Season 1. “White Lotus” Season 3 premieres on Max on February 16. (Max, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) This show is new, at least in the television format. One of cinema’s ultimate extraterrestrial baddies, the Xenomorph first introduced in Ridley Scott’s iconic 1979 sci-fi/horror “Alien,” will be back to terrorize audiences in this FX/Hulu series. The subtitle hints at another truly novel angle in this concept; perhaps on Earth, no one will be able to hear you scream either. It remains to be seen how much of the original universe’s story DNA will be findable here. “Alien: Earth” is coming sometime over summer 2025. The first season of this arresting post-apocalyptic series turned zombie stories – and video game adaptations – completely on their head, showcasing the talents of brooding leading man Pedro Pascal and a star-making turn from Bella Ramsey. Things don’t look to be getting much better for the pair in this second go-round, which will feature new cast members Catherine O’Hara and Kaitlyn Dever. “The Last of Us” Season 2 will premiere on Max in the spring. Playing on some of society’s deepest-seated fears, “Zero Day” imagines a world hobbled by a heinous global terrorist attack and the people who struggle to get ahead of it. The Netflix limited series features Robert De Niro, Jesse Plemons, Lizzy Kaplan and Angela Bassett in the role of the US president. “Zero Day” premieres on February 20. The sprawling world of “Game of Thrones” continues to unfurl with this prequel series, taking place in Westeros a century before the events depicted in “Thrones.” Based on author George R.R. Martin’s “Tales of Dunk and Egg” novellas, the show will center on the wanderings of “two unlikely heroes,” Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg, according to a news release. The show will come to Max in late 2025. Just when you thought it was safe to enjoy clowns again… Pennywise is back, this time in an HBO/Max prequel series set in the 1960s, leading up to the events depicted in 2017’s first big-screen installment. Bill Skarsgard, fresh from Nosferatu’s sarcophagus, is back as the horrifying demon-clown. A release for “Welcome to Derry” has not yet been specified, outside of 2025. The mind-bending world of “Severance” returns in January with a second season, sure to stupefy and shock with the help of Patricia Arquette’s villainous boss. As noted in our review of Season 1 in 2022, the best kind of science fiction sometimes feels set about 10 minutes in the future, and so it is with this extremely creepy, slow-moving but instantly engrossing show. “Severance” Season 2 premieres January 17 on Apple TV+. Season 1 of this “Star Wars” series features excellent casting and a grounded sense of reality embedded into the galaxy far, far away. The second season will further tie the action to 2016’s “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” which itself serves as a precursor to “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope” from 1977. “Andor” Season 2 comes to Disney+ on April 22. The macabre mayhem continues with Jenna Ortega in the delicious title role of this Addams Family offshoot, which scored big with audiences and critics alike – and even created a viral dance moment – in its first season. Look for a bunch of starry new cast additions this time around, including Steve Buscemi, Joanna Lumley and Thandiwe Newton. So far Netflix has revealed that “Wednesday” Season 2 “premieres in 2025.”"
Bruce Springsteen says Jeremy Allen White makes a good Boss,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/02/entertainment/bruce-springsteen-jeremy-allen-white-biopic/index.html,"Bruce Springsteen is singing Jeremy Allen White’s praises for his performance as The Boss himself in the upcoming biopic “Deliver Me from Nowhere.” The rock legend recently appeared on SiriusXM’s E Street Radio, where he spoke with host Jim Rotolo about his experience visiting the set and admitted that it was “a little bit” strange at first to see an actor “pretend” to be him. “But you get over that pretty quick and Jeremy is such a terrific actor that you just fall right into it,” Springsteen said. “He’s got an interpretation of me that I think the fans will deeply recognize and he’s just done a great job.” Springsteen added that he’s had “a lot of fun being on the set when I can get there.” He also spoke about how impressed he is by the “Bear” star’s singing voice and his ability to capture Springteen’s own distinct vocals. “He sings well,” he said. “He sings very well.” The biopic is based on Warren Zanes’ book “Deliver Me from Nowhere: The Making of Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska” and follows Springsteen’s journey making the 1982 album. “Nebraska” was released following Springsteen’s massively successful album “The River” and marked an important time in his life that he discussed only decades after its release. It  was recorded on a cassette in his bedroom without Springsteen’s signature E Street Band, according to a synopsis of Zanes’ book. The movie is directed by Scott Cooper and began filming in October. Jeremy Strong, Odessa Young, David Krumholtz, Gaby Hoffman, Stephen Graham and Paul Walter Hauser, among others, round out the cast. “It’s a tremendous cast of people,” he told Rotolo. “They cast the film beautifully, so it’s very exciting.”"
The movies we can’t wait to see in 2025,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/27/entertainment/2025-movie-preview/index.html,"After a year filled with animated inner emotions, mutants, aliens, gladiators and witches, the new year will bring a crop of new (or, newly revisited) movies to choose from, as always. Many upcoming films are sequels, reboots and franchise extensions, which can be chalked up to Hollywood’s penchant for playing it safe with known properties, but it’s also a testament to our collective desire to see where things go next for some of our most beloved characters and worlds. While by no means exhaustive, here is a collection of some of the big movies to look out for in 2025: It’s all in the title with this one, a Netflix spy movie marking the “return” of two beloved stars – Cameron Diaz, who had stepped away from the Hollywood feature film limelight for about ten years, and Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx, who is back after some health problems. The pair previously teamed up for 2014’s musical “Annie.” “Back in Action” will start streaming on January 17. After a relatively light year of content – with two welcome 2024 additions, in the movie sphere with “Deadpool & Wolverine” and on television with the deliciously witchy “Agatha All Along” – Marvel is beefing up again, bringing three new films to the MCU in 2025: “Captain America: Brave New World” (a.k.a. Cap’n America 4) in February, “Thunderbolts” in May and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” out on July 25. The latter of these stars Pedro Pascal, “Stranger Things” breakout Joseph Quinn, “The Bear’s” Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Vanessa Kirby, and amounts to the third big studio effort to bring this super-powered quartet to cinematic life (the first effort produced two movies, in 2005 and 2007, with a mostly ill-received reboot in 2015 with Miles Teller and Kate Mara). Over on the other side of the comic book pond, James Gunn is getting ready to launch his version of the DC Universe in bombastic fashion with “Superman,” previously titled “Superman: Legacy,” starring David Corenswet and “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” Rachel Brosnahan. This month’s teaser trailer previewed some drama and Clark Kent’s little (super)dog, too. “Superman” flies into theaters on July 11, two weeks ahead of “Fantastic Four.” (“Superman” is produced by DC Films, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) It’s been six years since visionary Korean director Bong Joon Ho wowed audiences with his Oscar-winning “Parasite.” His followup movie “Mickey 17” is finally coming in April after several delays. The film, which stars Robert Pattinson, looks to be a somewhat irreverent sci-fi comedy that nonetheless tackles some dark and heavy themes, following an “expendable” clone-type being who is tasked with a dangerous mission in outer space. “Mickey 17” docks in theaters on April 18. (The movie is a Warner Bros. Pictures release. The studio, like CNN, is part of Warner Bros. Discovery.) Speaking of sequels, this latest entry in the ever-expanding “Jurassic Park” dino-verse is getting points solely thanks to the cast, starring Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey, fresh off some “Wicked” success. “Jurassic World: Rebirth” is due on July 2. From dinosaurs to dragons. Universal and DreamWorks are taking a tip from Disney and reimagining one of their own top-performing animated franchises, which (unbelievably) first came on the scene 15 years ago. The new movie looks to be a faithful live-action adaptation of the first film, based on the book by Cressida Cowell. “How to Train Your Dragon” soars into theaters June 13. Speaking of big studio efforts to bring older properties back to cinematic life, this “Wolf Man” – not to be confused with 2010’s “The Wolfman” starring Benicio Del Toro – is an update to Universal’s classic monster movie from 1941, this time with “Girls” and “Poor Things” star Christopher Abbott in the hirsute titular role. “Wolf Man” crawls into theaters on January 17. After the extended success of “Cobra Kai,” which started out on YouTube before finding new life on Netflix, the franchise returns to the big screen just over 40 years after Ralph Macchio first did the crane kick in the original 1984 classic. Jackie Chan is back in the sensei-like role of Mr. Han, a role he first portrayed in the 2010 reboot opposite Jayden Smith. The titular “kid” this time will be played by up-and-coming star Ben Wang. “Legends” hits theaters May 30. After the blistering success of 2017’s “Paddington 2” (99% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is incredibly rare and impressive for a kid’s movie sequel), it was only a matter of time before we got this threequel, finding the charming stuffed bear Paddington in, well, Peru. Hugh Bonneville, Ben Whishaw and Imelda Staunton are all back for the ride, with Emily Mortimer joining the fun. “Paddington in Peru” comes to theaters on February 14. The second part of this year’s biggest movie musical event is slated to fly into theaters almost one full year to the day after Part 1 collectively wowed us. The second installment of the cinematic adaptation of the hit Broadway musical, which in turn was adapted from the 1995 Gregory Maguire novel, has been subtitled “For Good” in a nod to one of the show’s original songs. The sequel will catch up with now-estranged friends Elphaba and Glinda as they struggle to find their place in the big and wicked world of Oz. “Wicked: For Good” premieres in theaters on November 21, 2025. After much hype and a fair amount of speculation, the Michael Jackson biopic will hit theaters in the new year, with the King of Pop’s nephew Jaafar Jackson portraying the late superstar. The cast also includes Colman Domingo, Miles Teller, Nia Long and Larenz Tate. Sure to spark many “separate the art from the artist” debates, “Michael” will premiere in theaters on October 3."
‘Babygirl’ director says that scene involving a glass of milk actually happened to her,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/30/entertainment/babygirl-milk-scene/index.html,"Sometimes, the best on-screen stories are ones derived from real life – even if it involves a romantic glass of… milk. Yes, milk. It’s what Harris Dickinson’s character in the new erotic thriller “Babygirl” makes Nicole Kidman’s character drink at a bar amid their spicy romance, an experience the film’s director Halina Reijn said happened to her in real life. In the scene, Samuel (Dickinson), who is Romy’s (Kidman) significantly younger intern and her lover, orders Romy a glass of milk from across the bar. When she drinks it, Samuel says “good girl” to her as he leaves the bar. “The milk is, of course, an archetype,” Reijn told IndieWire in an interview published Saturday. “We’ve seen it in other movies. It is a great symbol of (the) animalistic sides of ourselves. It happened to me.” Reijn went on to describe her own encounter. She said it happened to her in Belgium years ago when she’d gone to a bar by herself and ran into a “young Belgian actor,” who she did not name but said was famous and “at least 15 years younger than I.” “He ordered me a glass of milk. I thought it was an incredible, hot thing to do, and so courageous, and so I wanted to reward him by drinking the whole thing, and I did,” she said. While Reijn admitted that she was “a little nauseated” from drinking the milk, she “did think that was one of the most arousing moments of my life” while she was writing the film’s script. She added that the mystery actor did not say “girl good” to her as Samuel tells Romy in the film. “I wish he did,” Reijn said. “He just walked out.” “Babygirl” was released on Christmas Day and follows Romy, a high-powered CEO who has a steamy affair with her much younger intern Samuel. Kidman, Dickinson, Antonio Banderas and Esther Rose McGregor star in the film. Cheers… we guess?"
There’s more to ‘A Complete Unknown’ than just Timothée Chalamet’s Bob Dylan,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/20/entertainment/a-complete-unknown-edward-norton-monica-barbaro-interview/index.html,"It’s not easy being a supporting act. Operating down the bill, you’re giving it your all in full knowledge you’re not the main attraction. Play your cards right though, and you might just steal the show. James Mangold’s Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown” may have its megawatt star in Timothée Chalamet, but his light isn’t so bright as to blind us from one of the year’s great supporting casts. While paying reverence to Dylan’s alien talent, Mangold takes time to show us the musician didn’t enter into the folk scene fully-formed, nor did he operate in isolation, peppering the film with a murderers row of ’60s musical figures, from acclaimed session artists to Dylan’s pen-pal the Man in Black himself, Johnny Cash (a charming Boyd Holbrook). Two of the most prominent names are Dylan’s mentor Pete Seeger, played by Edward Norton, and Dylan’s paramour and collaborator Joan Baez, played by Monica Barbaro. Both were established folk stars when the young Minnesotan formerly known as Robert Zimmerman rocked up to New York in January 1961, looking to catch a spark. Both would have to watch Dylan’s fame eclipse their own, before he broke from the folk establishment at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival by daring to “go electric.” Seeger takes Chalamet’s Dylan into his home and sets him up with his first gig, unleashing his talents on the world. Norton – arguably acting against type – brings warmth and decency to the part of the artist and prominent humanitarian who died in 2014, and who stood up to the House Un-American Activities committee in 1955 and refused to name names. “I loved every bit of being in Pete Seeger’s frequency, and his acetic world and his music. It was a privilege,” Norton told CNN. “When you speak to people who knew him, the afterglow that people still have from him is quite moving.” In the movie, Dylan quickly crosses paths by Baez, “the first lady of folk,” who’s already selling out theaters. Barbaro, a breakout in “Top Gun: Maverick” (2022) whose talents are confirmed here, said she decided to call up 83-year-old Baez in preparation. “I wasn’t sure what I was looking for, but I had been having dreams about talking with her,” she told CNN. “It felt like a very Joan thing to do, to be bold enough to reach out,” she continued. “I can’t imagine how surreal it would be to talk to an actress who’s portraying you in a movie, but she wasn’t really worked up about it, and I think that helped me, because I was really worked up about it.” “I felt the next day I could kind of let go a little bit,” she added. “That was the first day I performed in front of a live audience. I did a take and Jim (Mangold) was like, ‘Have more fun with it.’ And I felt for the first time really in the entire process that was available to me. I’d kind of crossed some threshold.” Following the first five years of Dylan’s career, Mangold’s film zig-zags across the US, using locations in New Jersey to stand for venues including The Gaslight Café and Carnegie Hall in New York, Monterey, California and Newport, Rhode Island. Driven in part by Chalamet’s years-long preparations to channel the bard, the film called on actors to perform live with period instruments, sometimes with as many as 30 microphones trained on them. (An album of live recordings will be released the same day as the movie in the US.) Surprisingly, Barbaro confessed she was “not at all” a singer before signing on to the project. Baez’s hit version of “House of the Rising Sun” “was the most intimidating (song), for sure,” said Barbaro. Performed in an intimate coffeehouse in front of record executives, with Dylan lurking in the wings (and quick to offer praise), “it’s the first time you hear her voice,” Barbaro added. “It’s slow and it’s difficult to sing. And I wanted to be a recognizable version of Joan immediately, so I felt a lot of pressure.” The actress allowed herself to cut loose on “It Ain’t Me Babe” – a personal favorite – performed with Chalamet in a reenactment of Dylan and Baez’s 1964 Newport Folk Festival duet: “We only had so many takes but it was just firecrackers. It’s a fun song, it’s a quick pace; there’s a lot of emotion between the two of them, and so much that I think we sought to express in that scene.” Norton was faced with a different challenge playing Seeger, a “true virtuoso” on the banjo said the actor. “There’s a great piece of footage I love of Pete Seeger playing Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’ on the banjo. And he was an animal – a beast of a musician.” “I’ve played guitar for a long time, so I wasn’t in the category of people who have never moved their pinky in those funny ways,” he explained. But to try and match Seeger? Forget about it. “You’re never going to get there. That would be hubris.” “You have to cleverly figure out the ways to approximate it and spend a lot of time on very few things … Put a few months into one solo (and) you can make it look like you know what you’re doing.” One aspect Norton didn’t have to work on was his connection with Chalamet. “We had a nice analogous relationship,” he said. “I’ve known Timothée for a while” – the two co-starred in Wes Anderson’s “The French Dispatch” in 2021 – “and I know he has a lot of respect for me, so the Pete-Bob dynamics were not difficult between us. “We didn’t rehearse it overly. I think we felt that a lot of these scenes were probably best discovered in the moment, and we did them very improvisationally. I loved it.” Both actors were quick to heap praise on their lead. “I heard some of (Chalamet’s) pre-records in the studio ahead of time and I heard how truly close he was getting to the voice,” said Barbaro. “By the time we were in music rehearsals and by the time we were filming, I had complete trust in everything he was bringing to the table.” “I can’t say enough about Timothée,” said Norton. “He led us in a way. He established very quickly a bubble of concentration and focus around the set. I’m not a big fan of visitors on sets, and I wondered what it would be like. He’s a huge star. And he was more disciplined than me. He created the capacity for us all to invest in the illusion … I think it took us all to a deeper place.” “I didn’t feel like I was hanging out with Timothée during it,” he added. “It’s a bold thing to play Bob Dylan. That’s really a high wire act – there’s a fall to your death about six different ways doing that as an actor. It’s pretty marvelous what he pulled off.” “A Complete Unknown” debuts in US cinemas on December 25 and in the UK on January 17."
Jennifer Lopez’s ‘Kiss of the Spider Woman’ reboot to premiere at Sundance: See the full festival lineup,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/11/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-sundance-2025-lineup/index.html,"Jennifer Lopez’s highly anticipated “Kiss of the Spider Woman” remake is set to premiere at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. The Sundance Institute on Wednesday announced their full lineup for the upcoming fest, with projects from Lopez, Benedict Cumberbatch, A$AP Rocky and Olivia Colman, among many others, set to be represented at the Park City, Utah festival. “Kiss of the Spider Woman” was produced by Lopez’s ex-husband Ben Affleck, along with Matt Damon and others. It’s based on the 1976 novel of the same name by Manuel Puig and was first adapted for the screen in 1985. That film starred William Hurt, Raul Julia and Sonia Braga, with Hurt winning the Oscar for best supporting actor. “Spider Woman” was also turned into a Tony-winning Broadway musical in 1993. Diego Luna stars alongside Lopez in the remake of the drama, which follows a political prisoner who forms an unlikely bond with his cellmate, who in turn “recounts the plot of a Hollywood musical starring his favorite silver screen diva, Ingrid Luna,” according to the festival release. Naturally, Lopez portrays the diva. Also set to make its world premiere at this year’s festival is the dramedy “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” about a mother on Long Island navigating her way through adversity that stars Rose Byrne, Conan O’Brien and rapper A$AP Rocky. Additional projects marking their world premieres are Olivia Colman and John Lithgow’s “Jimpa,” “Train Dreams” starring Joel Edgerton, Felicity Jones, Kerry Condon and William H. Macy, and “Rebuilding” starring Josh O’Connor along with “White Lotus” breakout Meghann Fahy. The festival will feature some buzzy documentaries including “Sally,” which will chronicle little-known parts of the life of Sally Ride, the first American woman to blast off into space, and the “Sly Lives!” doc, which will examine the life and legacy of funk band Sly and the Family Stone. “One to One: John & Yoko” – a documentary exploring the “seminal and transformative 18 months” that John Lennon and Yoko Ono spent living in Greenwich Village, New York City, in the early 1970s – will debut in the festival’s Spotlight program. The Sundance Film Festival will take place between January 23 and February 2 next year in Park City, Utah."
Rams roll to emotional victory over the Vikings to advance to divisional round showdown in Philly,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/sport/nfl-rams-defeat-vikings-in-arizona-spt/index.html,"The Los Angeles Rams paid tribute Monday night to the first responders and those impacted by the ongoing deadly wildfires in Southern California during the Rams 27-9 wild-card victory over the Minnesota Vikings. The NFL moved the game from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, to State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the home of the Arizona Cardinals, due to the fire threat. Before kickoff, the Rams’ mascot, Rampage, along with the Cardinals flag crew, ran onto the field with “LA Together” flags. A moment of silent reflection was later held for the victims of the wildfire prior to the National Anthem being played. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said it was important for the league to support the city of Los Angeles. “One of the things we wanted to do by playing this game tonight is send that message to the people back in Los Angeles that the NFL, this community, every community in this nation and around the world are there to support them, rooting for them and is going to be part of bringing LA back,” Goodell said in an ESPN interview prior to the contest. “This will be a celebration, honoring the people who are out there really fighting the fight.” The Rams donned custom Los Angeles Fire Department hats and shirts with the team logo on them and “Thank You Firefighters and First Responders” banners were displayed in the south end zone. To make the Rams feel at home, the Cardinals organization painted the field and end zone in the Rams’ blue and yellow colors. Arizona also provided two Boeing 777 planes to pick up 400 Rams players, coaches, personnel, their families and pets, according to the ESPN broadcast. Goodell said about 45,000 Rams fans made the trip. Former Rams captain and 2022 Super Bowl champion Andrew Whitworth thanked the first responders and shared an impassioned message to the Los Angeles community. “I believe in the people of Los Angeles. We are strong. We will not be defined by this devastation,” the 2021 Walter Payton NFL Man of the year told the crowd before the game. “We will rebuild LA hand in hand together, for as long as it takes.” As for the final contest of the wild-card round, the Rams jumped out early, scoring on their first two possessions —a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to running back Kyren Williams and on a Joshua Karty 34-yard field goal — to take a 10-0 first quarter lead. Up 10-3 in the second quarterback, Rams cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon sacked Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold causing him to fumble. Rookie linebacker Jared Verse scooped the ball up and took it 57 yards for the touchdown. Four minutes later, LA would extend its lead when Stafford threw his second TD of the game, a 13-yarder to tight end Davis Allen. The Rams’ defense gave Minnesota havoc in the first half as it sacked Darnold six times and forced two turnovers, one resulting in a touchdown. The Rams led 24-3 at the half. In the fourth quarter, Vikings linebacker Michael Hoecht and rookie defensive tackle Braden Fiske sacked Darnold for the team’s seventh of the game. Afterward, Hoecht honored his city by throwing up the “LA” sign. Los Angeles would sack Darnold nine times on the night to tie an NFL playoff record. After the game, Stafford addressed the obstacles the team overcame. “We knew what we were playing for today. It was go get this win but this is for the people of Los Angeles, struggling right now. It’s unbelievable to watch the whole community, the state, the country get behind them. It’s a tough time to be back there,” Stafford said. “We’re just happy we came out and played like this tonight to give us something to be happy about.” He added: “It was a tough week for us, a bunch of moving parts. Our organization did a hell of a job taken care of us. … It’s been a whirlwind.” The Rams will face the Philadelphia Eagles in the divisional round at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on Sunday at 3 p.m. ET."
Daniil Medvedev destroys a camera in outburst during tough Australian Open victory,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/sport/daniil-medvedev-destroys-camera-australian-open-spt-intl/index.html,"Daniil Medvedev used his racket to smash a camera attached to the net during a tricky opening round win at this year’s Australian Open. The world No. 5 eventually beat Thailand’s Kasidit Samrej in five sets – 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 – but had grown increasingly frustrated against an opponent ranked 418th in the world. It all boiled over for Medvedev at the end of the third set, with Samrej serving to take a 2-1 lead in the match. During a tense point, Samrej got lucky when his shot clipped the net, forcing Medvedev to change direction and sprint for the ball. The Russian star got there in time, but, now off balance, couldn’t do anything about Samrej’s cross-court winner that followed. As Samrej apologized for his fortunate shot, Medvedev took his frustration out on a small camera positioned in the center of the net, breaking both the camera and his racket in the outburst. The chair umpire subsequently gave Medvedev a warning for racket abuse. The 2021 US Open champion went on to lose the third set as Samrej, a wildcard for this tournament, took a step closer to the biggest win of his career at his debut grand slam event. However, it wasn’t to be for the 23-year-old with Medvedev recovering his composure to claim a tense five-set victory. Speaking during his post-match interview on court, Medvedev appeared to be in good spirits and didn’t mention his outburst at the end of the third set. Instead, he said how surprised he had been by the level of his opponent. “If he plays like this every match, his life can be good – money, girls, casino, whatever,” he joked. “I wish he could play like this every match.” Medvedev, a three-time finalist and last year’s runner-up at the Australian Open, will now face 19-year-old American player Learner Tien in the second round."
Los Angeles’ NBA teams return home hoping to provide a distraction from destructive wildfires,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/14/sport/nba-lakers-clippers-return-home-wildfires-spt/index.html,"Both of Los Angeles’ NBA teams returned to their respective home courts Monday night after having games postponed due to wildfires in the area. The Los Angeles Lakers returned to Crypto.com Arena for their first home game since January 3 while the Los Angeles Clippers played their first game at Intuit Dome since January 4. The Lakers had a pair of home games postponed last Thursday and Saturday while the Clippers had a single home game postponed on Saturday. Ahead of the game against the Miami Heat, Lakers guard Gabe Vincent addressed the crowd at Crypto.com Arena. “Just wanted to take a minute to acknowledge the tragedy that LA is dealing with at this time,” the Modesto, California, native said. “I speak on behalf of my teammates, this organization, our hearts go out to all those who have been affected by it. “We definitely want to give a good shout out to the first responders who are putting their lives on the line right now to protect our communities. I think it’s important at this time that we come together as a city, as a community, as a family and help support those who are in need right now. Go Lakers!” Lakers star LeBron James wore shoes honoring the Los Angeles Fire Department. Over at Intuit Dome, prior to the Clippers’ tipoff against the San Antonio Spurs, the lights were dimmed as the public address announcer read a heartfelt statement about the devastation of the fires and the resiliency of the city as a message of “LA Strong” was displayed on the scoreboard. Although wildfires continue to threaten the Los Angeles area, members of the Clippers welcomed the opportunity to return to the court upon learning their home schedule would resume on Monday. “When people are losing their homes, kids are losing schools, losing lives, it’s very difficult to approach the game of basketball because life is bigger than basketball,” head coach Tyronn Lue said Sunday. “Hopefully we can bring some kind of joy with the game coming back tomorrow and some togetherness and try to put some smiles on people’s faces in tough times.” Clippers forward Nicolas Batum admitted Sunday that his focus had been away from basketball, but he was also in favor of Monday’s game going on as planned. “We’ve been through the crazy stuff for the last five days,” Batum said. “I think maybe people need that to get their mind off of it for two, three hours.” The LA squads’ homecoming comes on the same day the two franchises, along with 10 other professional sports organizations across Los Angeles, have pledged “a combined donation of more than $8 million” to fire victims and those battling the fires. The donation was announced in a joint statement along with the Angel City FC, the Angels, Chargers, Dodgers, Ducks, Galaxy, Kings, LAFC, Rams and Sparks. The 12 teams have also joined forces with Fanatics to distribute $3 million worth of Fanatics merchandise to LA residents who have been forced to evacuate from their homes. In addition to the apparel items being donated by Fanatics, teams are collectively contributing thousands more items such as personal hygiene kits, school supplies, sneakers that will be given out at three upcoming events. Evacuated victims of the fires with proof of residency in evacuated zip codes will be able to participate in the distribution events on January 17 between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. PT at three locations – Dodger Stadium, SoFi Stadium and BMO Stadium. Last Friday, the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association announced they are donating $1 million for “immediate relief” to several organizations aiding wildfire relief efforts, including the American Red Cross and World Central Kitchen. The Lakers announced Sunday more efforts to help out the community. Starting at Monday’s game, the team began a donation drive at their home games to “support the Los Angeles community and relief efforts for the Southern California wildfires.” Additionally, the Lakers will use their practice facility, the UCLA Health Training Center in El Segundo, California, as a drive-thru donation center beginning on Tuesday. Both the Lakers and Clippers will spend much of the rest of January at home. After Monday night’s games, the Clippers play five of their next six games at home. The Lakers will play four of their next five games at home, with their lone road game coming against the Clippers at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California."
Takeaways from the wild-card round of the NFL playoffs,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/sport/nfl-wild-card-round-takeaways-spt/index.html,"The opening round of the NFL playoffs is one of the best football feasts of the year and this year’s edition has left us with some tasty matchups this coming weekend in the next phase. After five games, the Houston Texans, Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills have all advanced after blowing out the Los Angeles Chargers, Pittsburgh Steelers and Denver Broncos respectively. The Philadelphia Eagles moved on as well after a tough win over the Green Bay Packers. The matchup between the Washington Commanders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers was the highlight of the round. The close, back-and-forth game ended on an incredible game-winning field goal that doinked off the upright and bounced through to give the Commanders a 23-20 upset over the NFC South Division champions. The first round of the playoffs wrapped up Monday night with the Los Angeles Rams rolling over the Minnesota Vikings for an emotional victory after a week of devastation from the wildfires sweeping Southern California. The games next week: Houston-Kansas City at 4:30 pm ET on Saturday, Washington-Detroit at 8 pm ET on Saturday, Rams-Eagles at 3 pm ET on Sunday and Ravens-Bills at 6:30 pm ET on Sunday. Here are six takeaways from the opening round of the NFL playoffs: The specter of the wildfires in the Los Angeles area hung over Monday’s divisional playoff game days long before it even began. The Los Angeles Rams were the home team against the Minnesota Vikings on Monday, but the game itself was played in Phoenix – moved due to the devastation being wrought on Southern California. Emotional remembrances for the victims of the disaster marked the pregame ceremonies and the Rams themselves wore special LAFD gear on the sideline that honored the firefighters battling the blazes. Once the game got started, the emotion of the last week poured out of the Rams in the form of football dominance. The Rams jumped out early, scoring on their first two possessions —a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford to running back Kyren Williams and on a Joshua Karty 34-yard field goal — to take a 10-0 first quarter lead. From there, it was a clinc. Rams cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon sacked Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold causing him to fumble in the second quarter. Rookie linebacker Jared Verse scooped the ball up and took it 57 yards to the house to make it 17-3. Four minutes later, the Rams put up another touchdown to make it 24-3. At the same time, its defense was bringing Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold back down to earth with an interception and scores of sacks. It was an impressive performance from a team that had many more off-the-field distractions than almost any other in these NFL playoffs – only the Los Angeles Chargers could really empathize with how the Rams had to prepare for this one. But unlike the Chargers, the Rams’ are still playing after their 27-9 victory on Monday night. Ultimately, sports means so little when people are losing their lives and homes to a terrible natural disaster. But for the Rams and the people of Los Angeles, Monday’s romp over the Vikings hopefully provided a little bit of respite during an unbelievably sad period. The Washington Commanders have found themselves a good one in Jayden Daniels, the rookie quarterback who outdid Tampa Bay’s Baker Mayfield in the weekend’s standout game. It was Daniels leading Washington down the field on a game-winning drive, putting the exclamation mark on an incredible game: 24-of-35 for 268 passing yards and two touchdowns while leading the team in rushing with 36 yards. Daniels was returning to the scene of his first NFL start, which ended in a brutal 37-20 loss in Week 1. But the rookie who took the field on Sunday night was a different version of the Commanders quarterback. The former LSU Tiger looked like he’d been on this stage many times before, rushing and passing as he had all season and taking control of long drives that ended in Commanders points. Mayfield, meanwhile, continued his renaissance year with another strong performance – though a couple of key mistakes cost his team. Mayfield fumbled the snap on a drive that started in Tampa territory after the Bucs defense stopped Washington on fourth down. Linebacker Bobby Wagner jumped on the ball to give the Commanders near the Bucs end zone early in the fourth quarter. That turnover turned into a Daniels touchdown pass to wide receiver Terry McLaurin to go up 20-17. Mayfield answered that drive with one of his own to tie the game, making big plays with his arm – though a miscommunication with his center on a critical third down meant that the Bucs had to go for the three points instead of pushing for a go-ahead touchdown. After that it was time for Daniels to work his magic in the final minutes, as he had nearly all season. Needing points with the score tied 20-20, Washington found themselves with a third-and-six but Daniels found wide receiver Dyami Brown for a 21-yard strike to keep the drive going. A couple plays later, it was a beauty of a pass to Austin Ekeler that put the Commanders deep in Tampa territory, allowing them to start killing the clock. The rookie out of LSU made one final game-winning play, picking up a crucial first down on third-and-short after making a man miss when it looked like he’d be stopped in the backfield. From there, it looked elementary – except when Zane Gonzalez doinked the field goal off the upright. Luckily for the Commanders, it bounced through and handed Washington a postseason upset. Washington faces a tall task next as they face the NFC top seed Detroit Lions at Ford Field next weekend. It was a defensive struggle throughout the Philadelphia Eagles’ 22-10 win over the Green Bay Packers, but the tone was set on the game’s first play. Philly linebacker Oren Burks laid the boom against kick returner Keisean Nixon, who lost control of the ball. The Eagles emerged with the ball and possession on the Green Bay 27-yard line just seconds into the game. The Eagles were up 7-0 before two minutes had run off the clock. From there, it was a physical, smashmouth game and multiple Packers had to leave the game with injuries. The Packers, already playing without top wide receiver Christian Watson after a torn ACL in his knee last week, lost their top wide receivers Romeo Doubs and Jayden Reed to a suspected concussion and an upper-body injury. Packers quarterback Jordan Love threw two interceptions that didn’t result in any Philly points but kept the Packers from establishing any sort of offensive rhythm. The game largely stayed as an exchange of punts until late in the third quarter after the Packers used a lengthy drive to get their first field goal of the game. After that, physical runs by Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert and Green Bay running back Josh Jacobs provided a bit of spark as the physicality ratcheted up even further. Goedert’s touchdown run to put the Eagles up two scores was the kind of physical, Football Play (capital F, capital P) that gets the heart going. He delivered two punishing stiff arms and a lowered shoulder to the Packers’ Carrington Valentine and rumbled into the end zone, blunting the Packers’ momentum after they had just kicked a field goal at the end of a 12-play drive. On the ensuing drive, it was Jacobs’ turn to make another Football Play, running through and over Eagles defenders for 31 yards. His shirt was stretched out behind him as defenders hung on any way they could. He was initially signaled to have gotten into the end zone but was ruled down just short of the goal line. A play later, he drove it that final yard into the end zone to get the Packers within striking range. But the tough Eagles defense would not allow the Packers to go further than their own 41-yard line on their next possession and a turnover on downs largely put the game out of reach for Green Bay. The NFL playoffs got off on a strange, weird foot. The Chargers stormed out of the gate against the Texans but couldn’t get into the end zone on their first two drives and were only up 6-0. The game stayed that way for much of the first half until a turning point that set the tone for a wild second half. Pinned at the 1-yard line at the start of the drive, Houston’s offense came to life after a broken play, in which Stroud scooped up a botched snap and – while Chargers pass rushers Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack closed in on him near the sideline – the Texans signal-caller connected with wide receiver Xavier Hutchinson for a 34-yard gain. A couple of plays later, Stroud hit wide receiver Nico Collins for a 37-yard strike, and the duo capped the 10-play, 99-yard drive with a 13-yard touchdown for the 7-6 lead. From there, it was turnover city. The Texans fumbled on the opening drive of the second half and then forced a turnover on downs on the drive on the ensuing drive. Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert suddenly got a case of the yips, throwing three second-half interceptions – he had four in the game, more than he had in the entire regular season – and the Texans turned those picks into a blowout. The Chargers got one more big play – a long touchdown pass to wide receiver Ladd McConkey – but the Texans not only blocked the extra point but then returned it all the way to the end zone for a two-point conversion. It was the first time that had ever happened in the postseason and was the final nail in the coffin for the Chargers. The final score was 32-12 in favor of Houston, which will take on the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round next weekend. Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson and running back Derrick Henry might be enough on their own to carry the Ravens deep into the playoffs – and they showed why Saturday in a 28-14 thumping of the Steelers. The thunder-and-lightning duo highlighted a Baltimore running attack that went for a team postseason-record 299 yards, pacing the Ravens to a 28-14 win over their AFC North rivals. Henry ran for 186 yards on 26 tough carries, punishing the Steeler defense repeatedly with  runs right into the teeth of the defensive line. He found the right seams, breaking for a long touchdown run and a shorter bruiser for his two scores. Jackson meanwhile was electric as only he can be. He rushed 15 times for 81 yards while also completing 16 of 21 passes for 175 yards and two touchdowns. The rowdy 70,000 fans at M&T Bank Stadium routinely serenaded their star with chants of “M-V-P!” After the game, Jackson said watching Henry run is like being in a movie – “Cars,” specifically. “You know when Lightning McQueen just flying, flashing past?” Jackson said. “That’s how Derrick looks when he’s passing all those guys. And it look like a movie, bro.” Jackson and Henry simply ran through, around and over the Steelers’ defense on a massive drive to start the game, going 95 yards to open the scoring. The biggest play of the drive was Henry taking a direct snap and finding a seam in the Steelers’ front seven, bursting for 34 yards in a play that was punctuated by a brutal stiff arm that sent Steelers star safety Minkah Fitzpatrick reeling. Head coach John Harbaugh said that play was put into the playbook specifically for this game against the Steelers. The next drive showed it would be a bruising night for Pittsburgh. It was an 85-yard, 13-play drive in the second quarter that featured exactly zero passes. It ended with Henry pounding through the tackles one more time to get into the end zone, putting an exclamation point on a physically dominating drive. It would end up being the story of the game as the Steelers never got closer than two touchdowns again. Those “M-V-P” chants rang around Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, Sunday afternoon as Bills quarterback Josh Allen showed why it’s such a tight pick between him and Jackson for the award. Allen made some truly jaw-dropping throws on Sunday against the Broncos and used his feet to pick up some key first downs in the first half as Denver jumped out to an early lead. It was a play in the third quarter that truly exemplified where Allen’s game is at right now. On fourth and short near Denver’s end zone, Buffalo decided to go for it and Allen bounced around in the pocket, scanning for a receiver. As the pass rush closed in, it looked like it may be a killer sack. But just at the last moment, Allen was able to unfurl a gorgeous pass to the back of the end zone for running back Ty Johnson, who made an equally amazing catch – sliding and managing to keep his feet inbounds – for their second touchdown connection of the afternoon. The score was the 22nd postseason passing TD of Allen’s career, surpassing Hall of Famer Jim Kelly for the most in franchise playoff history. The fourth quarter started with another touchdown pass from Allen, who connected with Curtis Samuel on a third-and-6 pass for what would have been a first down. But Samuel went one better, spinning out of a tackle and sprinting to the end zone for a brilliant 55-yard touchdown. From there, the final quarter was a formality as the Bills defeated the Broncos, 31-7. The Bills victory means that there will be an absolutely epic showdown in the divisional round next week: Allen and the Bills vs. Jackson and the Ravens. It’ll be a matchup of two leading MVP candidates who were at the top of their game during this opening round. Voting for the MVP award took place at the end of the regular season, but maybe everyone should agree that the winner of that game takes home the award?

"With wildfire ‘three blocks away’ from her LA home, Naomi Osaka says she sent someone to get her daughter’s birth certificate",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/sport/naomi-osaka-los-angeles-home-wildfires-three-blocks-away-spt/index.html,"Naomi Osaka called her 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 win against Caroline Garcia in the Australian Open first round “an acceptable job.” But Osaka has more on her mind than seeking her fifth major title – and first title of any kind since becoming a mother. Her heart is with Los Angeles, as wildfires have been raging there for days. “I was watching the fire map, and the fire is like three blocks from my house. So I had someone go and get my daughter’s birth certificate and all that because I didn’t know what would happen if that burned down,” Osaka said in her on-court interview after her first-round win. “Sending all my love to LA. I know we hear about fires, but for me in particular, I didn’t know how devastating it could be. I just hope everyone’s doing well and I’m sending them all my love.” Osaka, seeking her third Australian Open title and first grand slam title since winning in Melbourne in 2021, later addressed reporters in a press conference wearing a Los Angeles Lakers jersey and a Los Angeles hat with a heart. She was asked about how she has kept her focus while knowing what’s been happening close to her house. “Honestly, I don’t think I’ve been doing the greatest keeping focus, but obviously I won, so I think it’s an acceptable job,” Osaka said. “It is really difficult for me because I think it’s tougher now because I find my home is more of a home because I have memories with my daughter, and there’s so many things like keepsakes and stuff like that, and obviously you can’t hoard them all when you’re asking someone to go to your house and just grab stuff. “So it is really tough in that sense, and I’m not there, so I don’t know how bad it is or how bad it’s going to get, but I think the biggest thing that I am grateful for is that everyone in my family is safe.” Osaka said she’s checking on the fire situation back home any chance she gets. “I don’t think I’ll go back to LA immediately after,” Osaka said. “I don’t feel like it’s safe enough to go back there, so it’s kind of a little bit in a limbo, but also motivating me to hopefully stay here as long as I can.” Osaka’s season got off to a promising start when she reached the final in Auckland, New Zealand. But after winning the first set 6-4 against Clara Tauson, Osaka was forced to retire because of an abdominal injury. It was her first final since returning from maternity leave 12 months ago. In Melbourne, Osaka has a potentially daunting Australian Open draw ahead – with players she’s familiar with. It started with Garcia. This Australian Open first round, the pairing had the feeling of déjà vu, but with a different result compared to 12 months ago. They have now faced each other three times at the Australian Open, including last year, with Garcia winning in 2024. Osaka passed the Garcia test and is now 3-2 in matches against her. In the second round, she’ll face a tough opponent in Karolína Muchová. Muchová beat Osaka in this same round last year at the US Open and went on to make a run to the semifinals. “Obviously I fell a little short in the US Open, but my outfit was spectacular,” Osaka said with a laugh. “But I’m hoping this time my tennis can shine a little bit better. And also, I love getting difficult draws, like I find that the most fun. It’s kind of like once you get a difficult draw you can prove that you’re the best of the best.” Should Osaka get past Muchová , she potentially could face Belinda Bencic – also back from maternity leave – in the third round. A fourth round could be against Coco Gauff. In head-to-head matchups, Muchová (2-1), Bencic (3-2) and Gauff (3-2) all have winning records against Osaka. This is also the same half of the draw as world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who is seeking her third straight Australian Open title."
Former UFC champion Khabib Nurmagomedov escorted off Frontier Airlines plane after exit-row dispute,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/sport/khabib-nurmagomedov-frontier-airlines-plane-spt-intl/index.html,"Former UFC champion Khabib Nurmagomedov “was asked to deplane” a Frontier Airlines plane after a disagreement over him sitting in an exit-row seat, the airline said in a statement to CNN. In a video that was shared on social media, Nurmagomedov can be seen in a tense discussion with a staff member on board the airplane before he departs the plane. The 36-year-old is widely considered to be one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time. In a post on Sunday on X about the incident, Nurmagomedov wrote that a “lady” had been “very rude” to him. “On Jan. 11, 2025, as flight 4401 from Las Vegas to San Francisco was preparing for departure, a flight attendant initiated the customary briefing for exit row passengers,” Frontier said in a statement. “Customer Khabib Nurmagomedov, who was seated in an exit row, was asked multiple times if he was willing and able to assist in the event of an emergency. “According to the flight attendant, Mr. Nurmagomedov did not respond, despite repeated attempts, which placed him in non-compliance with FAA requirements. As a result, he was asked to move to a different upgraded seat which he refused to do. “Therefore, in accordance with airline and FAA policy, he was asked to deplane. The decision to deplane the customer was in no way related to his ethnicity and we have refunded him and his traveling companions for their flights.” In the video, the staff gives Nurmagomedov the option of changing his seat to sit in a non-exit row, or exit the plane and rebook on another flight. She says the reason is because “flight attendants” are “not comfortable” with him sitting in the exit row. Nurmagomedov complains that that is unfair, and the staff says, “it is fair.” CNN was not able to determine what happened before the video began, and the video appears to be edited between the exchange and Nurmagomedov’s departure from the plane. Nurmagomedov wrote on X on Sunday after the incident: “Lady who comes to me with questions was very rude from the very beginning, even though I speak very decent English and can understand everything and agreed to assist, she still insists on removing me from my seat. “What was the base for that, racial, national or other one, I’m not sure. But after 2 minutes of conversation, she called security and I was deplaned from this aircraft, after 1,5 hour I boarded another airline one and left to my destination. “I did my best to stay calm and respectful as you can see on the video. But those crew members could do better next time and just be nice with clients.” CNN has reached out to Nurmagomedov for comment. The video begins with Nurmagomedov, who retired with an unbeaten 29-0 record, saying: “I know the language, I know English, I know how to help people.” The flight attendant replies that “it’s not about the language, sir,” before adding: “So what we’re going to do is we’re either going to have you switch your seat, because my flight attendants are not allowing you to sit in the exit row, or you’re going to have to get off this plane and then we’ll have to rebook you.” Numagomedov says it’s “not fair,” adding: “When I was making check-in, they asked me: ‘Do I know English?’ I said yes. Then why you guys do this?” Nurmagomedov retired in 2020 after victory over Justin Gaethje. He defeated Conor McGregor in a blockbuster bout in 2018 and in 2022 was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame."
A star NFL player was seen reading a self-help book during a playoff game. It’s now the top-selling book on Amazon,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/sport/aj-brown-reading-book-cec-spt/index.html,"Over the years, cameras have caught NFL players doing some memorable non-football things on the sidelines during games. Tom Brady once hurled an electronic tablet in frustration. Three members of the Seattle Seahawks were fined for eating hot dogs during a 1995 preseason game. On Sunday evening in Philadelphia, as the Eagles hosted a playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, wide receiver A.J. Brown did something arguably even more intriguing. He sat down and opened a book. As the Eagles ground out their 22-10 victory, cameras showed Brown on a sideline bench, studying a well-worn paperback. One of the Fox Sports broadcast announcers chuckled. “I haven’t seen too many people read books (during a game),” he said. The book is called “Inner Excellence: Train Your Mind for Extraordinary Performance and the Best Possible Life.” It was written by Jim Murphy, a former professional baseball player and self-described “performance coach” who helps athletes build mental toughness. Brown is one of the Eagles’ best players. Only three passes went in his direction on Sunday, and he caught only one, for just 10 yards. Still, when he took questions after the game, he was cheerful. This may have been the first time he’d been reading on camera. But he said it wasn’t the first time he’d read that book during a game. “That’s a book that I bring every single game,” Brown said, adding that “my teammates call it ‘The Recipe.’” Some passages were underlined and highlighted. Naturally, viewers were curious. The Eagles have a lot of fans, and the book quickly soared up the charts. On Monday afternoon, it was #1 on Amazon’s bestsellers list. “As an outfielder in the Chicago Cubs organization, my sense of worth and identity revolved around my performance, mostly my batting average,” Murphy writes in the book’s introduction. “When I hit well, I walked tall and felt great. When I hit poorly, my shoulders slumped and my outlook was dark. Life was a roller coaster of emotions. I was a slave to results and it stifled my performance. I was afraid of failure and that fear kept putting my mind in the past and future. “When I started coaching professional and Olympic athletes, I saw this over and over again: athletes had lost their joy and passion for life as they struggled under the pressure to perform. The fear of failure engulfed their lives.” The book has helped propel athletes to higher levels of performance even when they were filled with doubt, Murphy writes. “But far more than that,” he adds, “you’ll learn how to live with deep contentment, joy and confidence in your everyday life.” Brown told reporters the book helps him refocus after every drive, “regardless of if I score a touchdown or I drop a pass.” He will get more chances next Sunday, when the Eagles host another playoff game. A reporter for Sports Illustrated reached Murphy by phone on Sunday night, as his book was suddenly going viral. Murphy said of Brown, “It’s really an honor to be a part of his life and to have a meaningful place in anyone’s life.” By Monday afternoon, the book had at least one new five-star Amazon review, from a user named Todd. The headline of the review said “Go Birds.” The full text of the review said, “AJ Brown recommended this book, so I’m looking forward to reading this. Fly Eagles Fly.” At least 1,044 people found Todd’s review helpful."
New England Patriots hire former player Mike Vrabel as head coach,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/sport/mike-vrabel-new-england-patriots-head-coach-spt-intl/index.html,"The New England Patriots have hired their former player, Mike Vrabel, as their new head coach, the team announced on Sunday. Vrabel replaces Jerod Mayo – another former Patriots player – who was fired shortly after the Patriots’ Week 18 game last Sunday. He becomes the 16th head coach in the franchise’s history and just the seventh person to become the head coach for a franchise they once helped win a Super Bowl as a player, joining Mayo, Bart Starr, Forrest Gregg, Art Shell, Jeff Saturday and Jason Garrett, per ESPN. The 49-year-old has been out of work since being fired as the Tennessee Titans’ head coach in 2023. During his time in Nashville, Vrabel led the Titans to a 54-45 record between 2018 and 2023, and the playoffs three times. He also won the Coach of the Year accolade in 2021. In a turn of fate, Vrabel’s Titans eliminated the Patriots from the playoffs in 2019, marking the end of Tom Brady’s era with the team. The former linebacker played for New England for eight years between 2001 and 2008, winning the Super Bowl three times and being named a First-Team All-Pro. Vrabel was named into the organization’s Ring of Honor in 2023 and now returns to Massachusetts to help turn around a team which finished with a 4-13 record last season. Despite the lowly record, there are still signs of hope for New England though, in particular in the form of quarterback Drake Maye who shone in his rookie season and cornerback Christian Gonzalez. Vrabel is the first coach since 1950 to directly succeed another coach where both had played together in the NFL as teammates since Gregg took over for Starr as Green Bay Packers head coach in 1984, per NFL Research."
"‘I’ve not wept or wailed like that in several years,’ says Lakers coach JJ Redick after losing his home in the Palisades fire",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/sport/jj-redick-pacific-palisades-fire-spt-intl/index.html,"Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick lamented losing “things that you can’t replace” as he described the pain of seeing his rental home burned down in the Pacific Palisades wildfire. Speaking to reporters on Friday following the Lakers’ practice, an emotional Redick said that he witnessed “complete devastation and destruction” in his local community when he returned home in the aftermath of the fire. “I went through most of the village and it’s all gone, and I don’t think you can ever prepare yourself for something like that,” Redick said. “Our home is gone. “We were renting for the year to try to figure out where we wanted to be long-term. Everything we owned that was of any importance to us, almost 20 years together as a couple and 10 years of parenting, was in that house. There’s certain things that you can’t replace, that will never be replaced.” He added: “It’s an awful feeling to lose your home. I think what has happened over the last 72 hours from me being up there and from having a number of people that had homes in the Palisades that are also staying at the hotel, you really get a sense of just the communal destruction. I got back to the hotel, and of course my wife and I are emotional. I’m not sure I’ve wept or wailed like that in several years.” Redick was a basketball analyst for ESPN prior to becoming a head coach and moving to the Los Angeles area. During his 15-year playing career, he spent four seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers. “The Palisades community has really just been so good to us,” Redick said while fighting back tears. “I think that’s the part for us that we’re really struggling with, is just the loss of community. And I recognize that people make up community, and we’re going to rebuild, and we want to help lead on that. But all the churches, the schools, the library, it’s all gone.” After speaking with reporters, Redick was comforted by Lakers guard Austin Reaves on the team’s practice court. Los Angeles were scheduled to return to the court on Saturday night against the San Antonio Spurs at Crypto.com Arena but the game has been postponed. “The Los Angeles community is on our hearts,” the team said in a statement. “The Lakers look forward to getting back on the court soon, honoring LA’s first responders and recognizing the heartbreak endured across our beloved community.” The Clippers were set to host the Charlotte Hornets at the Intuit Dome on Saturday but that game has also been postponed. More than 100,000 residents remain under evacuation orders as fires continue to sweep across LA County and fire departments battle to contain them. Officials have confirmed at least 11 deaths but say it’s not yet safe to assess the true total. Redick was not the only NBA coach to be affected by the fires. On Thursday, Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said that his childhood home in Pacific Palisades, where his mother still lived, has been destroyed. “That’s my hometown, and all my friends who are from there, pretty much they’ve all lost their homes, their family homes, childhood homes,” Kerr told reporters. “Our whole high school’s gone. The town looks like it’s just been completely wiped out … It’s hard to even fathom how Pacific Palisades rebuilds and how it becomes a thriving community again. It’s just shocking.”"
"With an old rival at his side, Novak Djokovic resumes his quest for a 25th grand slam title at the Australian Open",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/sport/novak-djokovic-andy-murray-australian-open-tennis-spt-intl/index.html,"Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray faced each other 36 times throughout their tennis careers, mostly in finals and often at the sharp end of grand slam tournaments. But at this year’s Australian Open, their decades-long rivalry has taken an unexpected turn. In his ongoing pursuit of a record-breaking 25th major title, Djokovic has enlisted Murray, recently retired but not prepared to walk away from tennis entirely, as part of his coaching team. It was an arresting sight for tennis fans when the pair first appeared in Melbourne together this week, Djokovic striking balls in practice and Murray looking on with hawk-like attention. But might this unusual player-coach partnership make sense? “It’s in search of perfection that Novak Djokovic, I think, hires Andy Murray,” seven-time grand slam champion and Eurosport expert Mats Wilander told CNN Sport. “We mustn’t think that he’s going to be five percent better because of Andy Murray … We’re talking about one or two points here and there,” Wilander added. “Murray might have some valuable information that Novak hasn’t thought about before, and that could be the difference between him winning his 25th grand slam title or not.” Currently tied with Australian Margaret Court at the top of the all-time list, Djokovic was expected to become tennis’ outright grand slam singles leader with one more title last year. But despite adding an Olympic gold medal to his trophy cabinet, he went the whole season without winning a major crown for the first time since 2017, falling short against Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final. At the upcoming Australian Open, a tournament he has won a record 10 times before, Djokovic resumes his quest for tennis history. Four months out from his 38th birthday, he would comfortably be the oldest grand slam singles champion in the Open era should he triumph in Melbourne, though we have seen many times how the Serbian star can bend and flex his body in ways that defy his advancing years. These days, rather than play a full schedule, Djokovic tends to target a handful of tournaments in order to preserve his fitness and prolong his career. Such an approach means that his ranking has suffered, and he enters the Australian Open as the seventh seed with a tricky draw in front of him. Four-time grand slam champion Alcaraz could be Djokovic’s opponent as soon as the quarterfinal, perhaps the latest instalment in what has become an intriguing rivalry. “He needs a bit of luck,” Saša Ozmo, a journalist for Sportklub who has covered Djokovic’s career extensively, told CNN Sport prior to the draw. “But I think if it can open just a bit for him and if he can get into the groove, slowly but surely, I’d say he’s among the favorites. Not the top favorite, but among the favorites.” Jannik Sinner, the world No. 1 and defending Australian Open champion, enters the men’s draw as the player to beat. He won his first grand slam title in Melbourne last year, then ended 2024 with victories at the US Open and the ATP Finals to cement his place at the top of the rankings. Alcaraz, meanwhile, could become the youngest player to achieve a career grand slam – needing only the Australian Open to complete a sweep of the majors four months before his 22nd birthday – and second seed Alexander Zverev continues to chase a first grand slam title after a strong season last year. But no one will be discounting Djokovic from triumphing once more at his favored event, even after he was surprisingly beaten in straight sets by Reilly Opelka at the Brisbane International last week. In former world No. 1 and three-time grand slam champion Murray, he not only has a coach who is familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the world’s top players, but also a friend and rival helping him to raise his game. “I think that motivation is a big thing,” veteran coach Brad Gilbert told CNN’s Don Riddell earlier this week. “Having that motivation to want to go to practice and want to work hard for somebody, that will help. And I think that’s one thing that Andy can provide.” Djokovic himself has said how he “caught (Murray) a little bit off guard” with the coaching offer, but remains confident that the unlikely collaboration will bear fruit. “Being on the same side of the net is actually great for a change,” he explained last month. “He’s been one of my greatest rivals and, in a way, it was strange for me to share all these insights about how I feel on the court, sharing some of the secrets of what I’m going through, what I’m thinking about, how I see my game with somebody that has been always one of the top rivals. “He has a unique perspective on my game as one of the greatest rivals that I’ve had. He knows the pros and cons of my game and he has also played up to recently on the tour, so he knows all the other best players currently in the world – the youngsters and their weaknesses and strengths in their games. I look forward to it, I really do.” It’s a surreal twist of fate to see Murray and Djokovic hitting together on practice courts at the Australian Open, 14 years after they first faced each other in a major final at the same tournament. It was Djokovic who triumphed on that occasion, claiming his second grand slam crown in Melbourne. Few could have predicted what would follow: eight further Australian Open titles, a record 428 weeks at the top of the rankings, and a career like none we have seen before. In virtually every category for men’s tennis – grand slams, Masters titles, time spent as world No. 1 – Djokovic is unmatched. With nothing left to prove, he still feels compelled to accomplish more, to extend further the boundaries of what it is possible to achieve in a single career. “To be honest, I don’t really see what the 25th title would change,” said Ozmo, adding: “For me, undoubtedly, he’s the greatest of all time. I think even people who used to say, ‘It’s a fight, it’s close’ – they’re giving up too. “He’s just making up goals now and he’s setting up new goals just to try to keep himself motivated.” For Wilander, the debate about the greatest of all time is purely a matter of taste and semantics; but when it boils down to results – the player who has achieved the most on the court – in his mind there is no debate left to be had. “The greatest could be Roger Federer, it could be Björn Borg, it could be anyone, but the best of all time is Novak Djokovic, that’s for sure,” said Wilander. “There is no question in anybody’s mind that he is the best ever.” The next two weeks in Melbourne are another opportunity to find out what this extraordinary athlete can still achieve."
"Gaël Monfils becomes oldest ever winner of an ATP Tour title, surpassing Roger Federer",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/sport/gael-monfils-oldest-winner-atp-tour-title-spt-intl/index.html,"French tennis star Gaël Monfils became the oldest ever player to claim an ATP Tour singles title when he won the ASB Classic in Auckland on Saturday, surpassing the previous record set by Roger Federer in 2019. The 38-year-old won the ATP 250 tournament after defeating Belgium’s Zizou Bergs 6-3 6-4 in the final to claim his 13th tour-level title. “It means a lot (to win). Age is a number,” said Monfils in his on-court interview afterwards. “But we keep working. I keep believing that I can play high-quality tennis and I have been showing it this week so I am very happy. “(My first title) was 20 years ago. I still have the passion to play tennis. I feel I’m still striking the ball very well. Hopefully, many more to come.” At 38 years and four months, Monfils is two months older than Federer was when he won in Basel six years ago. The world No. 52 has been a mainstay on the ATP Tour for more than two decades, winning his first title in 2005 and reaching a career high ranking of world No. 6 in 2016. He broke Bergs at the first attempt on Saturday when the Belgian caught the net tape with a wayward forehand, and then raced into a 3-0 lead in the first set. Bergs never really troubled that advantage, his second serve proving so unreliable that he only won 33% of those points, and Monfils wrapped up the set after 48 minutes of play. Monfils once again broke Bergs early in the second set and clung on to his lead to secure the win. Both players will now turn their attention to the Australian Open. Monfils will face his 21-year-old compatriot Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the first round, while Bergs will play Argentina’s Facundo Díaz Acosta."
Coco Gauff writes message of support for Los Angeles after winning in Australian Open first round,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/sport/coco-gauff-australian-open-la-wildfires-spt-intl/index.html,"After winning her first round match at this year’s Australian Open, Coco Gauff sent a message back to Los Angeles where the wildfires continue to cause widespread devastation. Firefighters are now said to be in a critical stage of their almost week-long battle against deadly blazes across LA County. Crews have reported progress but officials say the fire threat will remain very high as dangerous winds return this week. Officials say that at least 24 people have died, and dozens are missing. US star Gauff beat her compatriot Sofia Kenin 6-3 6-3 on Sunday, before writing on a camera lens as she made her way off the court: “Stay strong LA, thank you firefighters.” Gauff is one of the favorites to win the title in Melbourne and made light work of what could have been a tricky opening round. Kenin, the 2020 Australian Open champion, beat Gauff at Wimbledon 18 months ago but much has changed since then. The 20-year-old is now in great form and is the leading light for the US at this year’s grand slam. “It was a tough match for me today. I knew going in it was going to be difficult, but I’m happy with how I played,” Gauff said in her post-match interview. “I maybe could’ve served some second serves better but I was struggling to see the ball so I’m just happy I was able to manage through that today.” Gauff will play Britain’s Jodie Burrage in the next round. While the fires have not stopped America’s top stars from participating in the first grand slam of the new season, it has impacted some of the players at the tournament. Croatian star Donna Vekic, for instance, is competing in Australia without her coach Pam Shriver, who is back in LA supporting her family. Shriver, a former US tennis star, wrote on Instagram that her house was still standing but that she was staying in a hotel room. “It’s a very difficult situation for her,” Vekic told reporters after beating France’s Diane Parry on Sunday. “She’s home in LA. Her house is OK for now, but so many have lost everything, and it’s a horrible situation.” Gauff is joined in the next round of the tournament by compatriot Jessica Pegula, who thrashed Australian wildcard Maya Joint 6-3 6-0 in a dominant display on Sunday. Meanwhile, world No. 2 Iga Świątek looked impressive as she beat Czech player Kateřina Siniaková in straight sets. After the game, Świątek also wrote a message to those impacted by the wildfires. “Sending my love to Malibu and LA,” she scribbled on a camera lens on the side of the court. There were also no surprises for some of the favorites in the men’s draw as world No. 1 Jannik Sinner beat Chile’s Nicolas Jarry in straight sets to reach the second round and Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz also made light work of his opening match, beating Alexander Shevchenko without dropping a set. However, 11th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, a finalist in Melbourne two years ago, suffered a surprise defeat against American Alex Michelsen as he lost 7-5 6-3 2-6 6-4."
Texas man charged with stalking WNBA and Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/13/sport/texas-man-charged-stalking-caitlin-clark-spt/index.html,"Authorities in Indianapolis have charged a 55-year-old Texas man with felony stalking of Indiana Fever star and WNBA rookie of the year Caitlin Clark. Michael Thomas Lewis is accused of repeated and continued harassment of the 22-year-old Clark beginning on Dec. 16, the Marion County prosecutor’s office wrote in a Saturday court filing. Jail records show Lewis is due in court on Tuesday. Lewis posted numerous messages on Clark’s X account, according to an affidavit from a Marion County sheriff’s lieutenant. In one, he said he had been driving by the Gainbridge Fieldhouse — one of the arenas where the Fever plays home games — three times day, and in another he said he had “one foot on a banana peel and the other on a stalking charge.” Other messages directed at Clark were sexually explicit. The posts “actually caused Caitlin Clark to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened” and an implicit or explicit threat also was made “with the intent to place Caitlin Clark in reasonable fear of sexual battery,” prosecutors wrote in the Marion County Superior Court filing. The FBI learned that the X account belonged to Lewis and that the messages were sent from IP addresses at an Indianapolis hotel and downtown public library. Indianapolis police spoke with Lewis on Jan. 8 at his hotel room. He told officers he was in Indianapolis on vacation. When asked why he was making so many posts about Clark, Lewis replied: “Just the same reason everybody makes posts,” according to court documents. He told police that he didn’t mean any harm and told them he fantasized about being in a relationship with Clark. “It’s an imagination, fantasy type thing and it’s a joke, and it’s nothing to do with threatening,” he told police, according to the court documents. In asking the court for a higher than standard bond, the prosecutor’s office included that Lewis traveled from his home in Texas to Indianapolis “with the intent to be in close proximity to the victim.” The prosecutor’s office also sought a stay-away order as a specific condition if Lewis is released from jail ahead of trial. Prosecutors requested that Lewis be ordered to stay away from the Gainbridge and Hinkle fieldhouses where the Fever play home games. The Associated Press was unable to determine Monday if he has a lawyer who can comment on his behalf. The Associated Press named Clark the Female Athlete of the Year for 2024. After leading Iowa to last year’s national championship game, she was the top pick in the WNBA draft and went on to win rookie of the year honors in the league."
Houston Texans overcome slow start to rout Los Angeles Chargers in chaotic playoff matchup,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/sport/texans-defeat-chargers-wild-card-playoff-matchup-spt/index.html,"Powered by a stifling defense that intercepted Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert a career-high four times and an offense that came to life at the end of the first half, the Houston Texans’ wild-card victory sees them advance to the divisional round of the playoffs. The Texans overcame a slow start and early mistakes to defeat the Chargers 32-12 on Saturday in a chaotic AFC wild-card playoff matchup at NRG Stadium. “Man, what an awesome opportunity we had to play a playoff game here at home,” Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said after the game. “Just thankful for all our guys and the effort, the way they played today. That’s the complementary football that we have been looking for and we have been needing as a team. “Just outstanding performance on all three phases. Really proud of all our guys. I can go through each position group, everybody stepped up and made a play when we needed to make plays. Our best players stepped up and made big plays for us to win this game.” The Chargers opened  the game with promise, scoring two first-quarter field goals for a 6-0 lead. Meanwhile, Houston’s struggles on offense were evident early, with wide receiver John Metchie III fumbling on the Texans’ first offensive play after having the ball ripped out of his arms by Chargers’ Alohi Gilman at the Houston 33-yard line. The Chargers’ forced turnover led to their second field goal of the game. Over their next four offensive possessions, the CJ Stroud-led offense managed to get just two first downs, punting three times and turning it over on an interception, while netting a measly 40 total yards. Despite the Texans’ offensive struggles, the defense, anchored by edge rushers Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter, held Los Angeles in check, keeping the Chargers scoreless, while coming up with an interception of their own. Just as things seemed the bleakest, the Texans conjured up some magic. Pinned at the 1-yard line at the start of the drive, Houston’s offense came to life after a broken play, in which Stroud scooped up a botched snap, and while Chargers pass rushers Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack closed in on him near the sideline, the Texans signal-caller connected with wide receiver Xavier Hutchinson for a 34-yard gain. “That’s what it looks like when your best players step up and make the plays,” Ryans said of Stroud. “That’s what playoff football is about. That’s what being a big-time player in the league is about. “Of course, you see the fumble snap and I’m just thinking, please pick the ball up. And then we were able to see CJ improvise and see Hutch keeping his eyes downfield. Having that confidence in himself and ability to avoid the rush and still keep his eyes downfield and find Hutch, that was an outstanding play. “To me that was the play of the game that really created momentum for our entire team.” A couple of plays later, Stroud hit wide receiver Nico Collins for a 37-yard strike, and the duo capped the 10-play, 99-yard drive with a 13-yard touchdown for the 7-6 lead. Stroud finished the game with 282 yards, a touchdown and an interception, while Collins hauled in seven catches, and 122 yards and a touchdown. Following a Chargers three-and-out, Houston got the ball back with 27 seconds remaining in the first half. However, the Texans quickly gained 45 yards, including a Stroud 27-yard scramble to set up a Ka’imi Fairbairn 41-yard field goal for the 10-6 lead. With the momentum on their side following a disastrous start to the game, the crowd at NRG Stadium was sent into uproar after the Texans opened the second half with another big gain when Stroud connected with Collins for a 41-yard gain. However, those cheers quickly went silent on the next play, when running back Joe Mixon fumbled the ball and the Chargers recovered. As they had done all game though, the Texans’ defense came up clutch, forcing a turnover on downs to give the offense the ball again. Houston turned the defense’s effort into three points following a Fairbairn 37-yard field goal. Trailing 13-6 late in the third quarter, things went from bad to worse for the Chargers, after Herbert was picked off for a second time, and Texans safety Eric Murray took it to the house for the pick-six to extend the Texans lead to 20-7. Herbert, who had thrown just three interceptions in the regular season, was picked off for a third time on the ensuing possession when All-Pro cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. came up with the pick that deflected off Chargers tight end Will Dissly Jr. and returned it for 54 yards to the Chargers 13-yard line. The Texans’ offense turned that into three more points to go up 23-6 early in the fourth quarter. Facing a third-and-26 after Herbert was sacked twice by Will Anderson and Mario Edwards, the Chargers got back into the game, after rookie wide receiver Ladd McConkey hauled in a pass and took it 86 yards into the end zone to cut the deficit to 23-12. However, the Chargers’ extra point attempt was blocked by Texans’ Denico Autry, and after kicker Cameron Dicker tried to jump up and bat the ball down, it bounced to D’Angelo Ross, who grabbed the loose ball and took it into the end zone for two points. The Texans added another touchdown after Mixon rushed in for the 17-yard score to close out a 14-play, 74-yard drive that took nearly seven minutes off the game clock. Houston’s defense closed out the dominant effort by intercepting Herbert for a fourth time to secure the victory. “It’s tough, I let the team down,” Herbert said after the game. “You can’t turn over the ball like that and expect to win and put the team into a tough position with four turnovers like that.” The loss marks the second consecutive year the Chargers have been eliminated in the wild-card round."
‘It has skyrocketed’: How flag football established itself on the US sporting landscape,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/sport/flag-football-big-business-spt-intl/index.html,"When Tatiana Dos Santos started playing flag football, she did so on a dirt field in Panama. By the time she left high school, she had played at the NFL Pro Bowl, held at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. It has been a remarkable rise for someone who is now competing at the elite level, but Dos Santos’ story is also a mirror for the progress that the sport, which is due to make its Olympic debut in 2028, has made as a whole. “All of these things just keep upgrading,” Dos Santos, who last year helped the Ottawa Braves to their fourth straight NAIA Finals title, told CNN Sport’s Coy Wire. “I started playing in the dirt. And I came all the way up to playing on these big fields, universities, and also stadiums – we play our national championships in the (Atlanta) Falcons stadium, the Mercedes-Benz (Stadium).” In many ways, it should come as no surprise that athletes like Dos Santos are competing on some of the NFL’s most iconic stages. Played by more than 20 million people in more than 100 countries, flag football is expected to overtake tackle worldwide in terms of organized participation opportunities in the next few years, according to the International Federation of American Football (IFAF). The growth of the sport in the US, where flag football is now played by the NFL’s biggest stars as part of the Pro Bowl, has been just as striking. “I started in 2018, and the sport has skyrocketed,” said NFL FLAG executive director Izell Reese. “When I started with NFL FLAG … players were roughly about 200,000 participating. It has ballooned to 800,000 participating.” At the high school level, 42,955 girls participated in the 2023-24 season, a 105% increase from the previous year. The game is doing just as well at the collegiate level. In December, Alabama State announced Jennifer Constuble as the first ever women’s flag football coach in Division I athletics. This growth has allowed – and been spurred on by – international scholarship opportunities for young athletes like Dos Santos to study at universities and colleges such as Ottawa University. “It’s just crazy,” said the Braves wide receiver. “Thinking about how I came from a small town in the west side of Panama, all the way to be in Kansas, winning national championships and being able to get a scholarship – it’s such a proud moment.” Flag football has been aided to no end by the support of the financial behemoth that is the NFL. “They’ve got the full breadth of the NFL using their marketing horsepower,” said Reese. “They’ve nationally televised the FLAG Championships in Canton, Ohio on ESPN, for instance. They used a Super Bowl commercial in past years as well.” Individual NFL teams have also played their part in growing the game. “Having NFL teams involved, having the players involved, both active and former – you’re really seeing the breadth of the NFL and them looking at this as a priority,” added Reese. Rockford Park District Youth Sports Manager Lamont Jones has seen firsthand the influence this can have, whether that is through teams investing in Parks and Rec programs, donating turf for training facilities, or sending NFL players to connect with the district’s young athletes. “We would not be where we’re at right now in the state of Illinois if it wasn’t for the Chicago Bears,” he said. “When the Chicago Bears reached out to us about high school girls flag football, it was just a no-brainer.” The effect of all this investment has seen the sort of growth which may be starting to allow the sport to stand by itself. The American Flag Football League (AFFL), previously only an amateur tournament, is due to launch a professional league in spring 2025 with players earning $1,000 a week. Its first franchises, the Boston Brigade and the Las Vegas Lucky 7s, were bought from the league for $3 million each in 2022. Equally important to the sport’s boom is the nearly 30% increase in equipment sales, as reported by the Sport and Fitness Industry Association. “You start thinking about all those jerseys, all those flag belts, all those footballs, all those participants, all those tournaments and events. Youth sports tourism is a big thing,” pointed out Reese. “That multi-billion dollar industry of youth sports – flag is a skyrocket for that, and one of the biggest growth sectors. “You’re just starting to see the industry start to involve. You’re starting to see Nike, Adidas, all of these apparel companies now wanting their brands to be donned and worn across collegiate, high school and youth.” Players and coaches across all levels of the game have been reaping the benefits of improved equipment. “Freshman year we were using the reused soccer jerseys,” said Lainey Thatcher, a student at Dunwoody High School in the Atlanta area. “And (now) we have our own flags with our names. We used to just have yellow flags with nothing on them. Now we have our own customized flags and it’s really nice.” Kevin Fraser, flag football head coach at Pope High School, also just north of Atlanta, has seen similar developments. “We use wristbands now that we didn’t use our first year for play-calling, so the girls can see. I have a software system that I can basically draw out plays on and can fit it on a little card. The first year I was drawing cards on literally note cards and laminating them, and that was the play call!” he said. “Now they’ve got 24 drawn plays on their wristband. “Without that now, I would be like, ‘I’m out!’” Success breeds success, and the growth of flag football has seen the sport secure a place at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. “When would anyone think that a sport like flag football would be part of the Olympics!” smiled Dos Santos. “You would never think that!” With current NFL players interested in competing, there are hopes that flag football might see something akin to the so-called “Dream Team,” the 1992 US men’s Olympic basketball team featuring the likes of Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Charles Barkley. If NFL teams allow their players to join the Olympic effort, a star-studded lineup would no doubt see another financial boom for the sport. But, even if they don’t, one thing is for sure: flag football is not going back to the dirt field any time soon."
Hope for old DC: The Washington Commanders return to the playoffs ready for a new era,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/sport/washington-commanders-nfl-wild-card/index.html,"Even from the top of section 412 – the standing room area that’s about as far as one can get from the battle taking place between the Washington Commanders and the Atlanta Falcons – Northwest Stadium is a cauldron of noise. On this rainy, unseasonably warm December night, the Commanders are playing in the weekend’s premier game and aiming to clinch their first NFL playoff berth since the 2020 season. Here in the upper reaches of the stadium, the wind whips the rain into the faces of fans as they roar, creating a din that only gets louder as the Falcons’ offense takes the field for the opening drive – somehow ratcheting up even more when the Commanders force an interception. It’s the kind of atmosphere that marks a big game in a football town that is once again getting used to them. The scene could not be more different than that Covid-19-afflicted campaign four years ago. The team then had a different name and a losing record, even though it won the NFC East division crown. There were no fans in the stands that season – only cardboard cutouts that made no noise and showed no emotion. There’s noise in Landover now, and it sounds a lot like hope. There are many reasons for that hope. From the front office to the field – and even to the halls of Congress – there are signs that football in Washington, DC, is once again being revived. More importantly, there is true belief that this revival can actually stick. The 12-5 Commanders are coming off their best season since 1991 and take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (10-7) at 8 p.m. ET Sunday in the penultimate game of the Wild Card round of the NFL playoffs. It’s another primetime slot for a franchise looking to advance past the first round of the playoffs since the 2005-06 season. But regardless of what happens against the Bucs on Sunday, this season already qualifies as a success – and a potential turning point – for the Commanders. Tress Way, the team’s punter and most-tenured member, believes the recipe is simple. “I feel like even more than just like clinching the playoffs, it’s more of like – winning, I guess,” he told CNN Sport in the locker room after the Commanders beat the Falcons to secure their spot in the postseason. Way allowed himself a chuckle: “Just – we have so many wins!” From the early 1980s to the early 1990s, the then-Washington Redskins were the toast of the NFL. Three Super Bowl championships in 1982-83, 1987-88 and 1991-92, another appearance in 1983-84 and a slew of playoff berths meant that DC was one of the centers of the football universe. But after that Super Bowl in 1992, the wheels fell off. The team made the playoffs the year after their Super Bowl triumph but then didn’t play another postseason game until January 2000. Since that last Super Bowl win in the 1991-92 season, Washington has returned to the playoffs eight times and only advanced out of the first round on three occasions. High-profile and high-priced, players came and went without bringing the kind of success that Washington fans were used to. Mediocrity on the field not only became expected, it became the new normal. Off the field, more decisions were being made that annoyed the fanbase. The team decided to leave their longtime home at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in southeastern DC for a new stadium in Landover that was initially the largest in the league before tens of thousands of seats were removed over the next two decades. Known for decades as FedEx Field, the stadium developed a reputation as hard to get to, hard to leave thanks to crushing traffic, expensive and not exactly aesthetically pleasing. After owner Jack Kent Cooke’s death in 1997, longtime fan Daniel Snyder bought the team, beginning a period of frustration and disappointment that eventually metastasized into toxicity on such a level that Congress got involved. One of Snyder’s nemesis in the Washington mediasphere, Dave McKenna, chronicled many of the fanbase’s frustrations with the franchise for the Washington City Paper in 2010. But no matter what bad press or controversy followed the then owner around, or how many empty seats appeared during games, it seemed like nothing would change – especially given the stubbornness around changing the team’s name. Known as the Redskins ever since the team arrived in Washington from Boston in 1937, the name’s reference to skin color, as well as its logo depicting a Native American with feathers in his hair, has been criticized at least as far back as 1971-72. Still, the team steadfastly resisted efforts to change its name. However, the franchise faced renewed pressure to finally do so in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd sparked mass protests seeking to end systemic racism. FedEx, the sponsor of the team’s home stadium at the time, asked the team to change the name in response to growing pressure from investors. Companies including Nike, Amazon, Target and Walmart said they would stop selling the team’s merchandise. Snyder eventually announced the decision to change the name in July 2020. It’s a decision that still divides Washington football fans. The team competed as the Washington Football Team in 2020 and 2021 before adopting the Commanders moniker in 2022. Snyder eventually decided to explore a sale of the team in November 2022 and completed the deal in 2023, selling to the current ownership group led by Josh Harris. But on the way out, there was one final embarrassment: a $60 million fine by the NFL against the old owner following the release of an independent investigation, which found workplace misconduct and financial improprieties while Snyder owned the team. At least 15 women – 13 former staffers and two journalists – accused organization staffers of sexual harassment, leading to a congressional investigation into the organization and Snyder’s ownership group. Snyder was accused by then-House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney in a hearing that he “himself fostered” the football team’s “toxic workplace” and then “conducted a shadow investigation to target his accusers, pin the blame on others, and influence the NFL’s own internal review.” Maloney said that Snyder “fired women but not men who engaged in relationships with other employees, while defending male executives accused of sexual harassment,” according to testimony from former top team executives during the panel’s eight-month probe of the Commanders’ culture and the NFL’s response. In April 2022, the NFL hired former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairwoman Mary Jo White to investigate an allegation of sexual harassment against Snyder by former employee Tiffani Johnston, a former cheerleader and marketing manager for the team. Johnston told a congressional committee that the Commanders owner had put his hand on her leg under the table at a work dinner and tried to persuade her to get into his limousine. The investigation corroborated the complaints. Snyder has in the past denied the allegations. Under Harris, the Commanders have done their best to move on from the Snyder era. The best way to do that, Way said, is winning. “When Mr. Harris bought the team, he had lunch with a lot of us veterans, and he had said, ‘Hey, we’re gonna come in, we’re gonna make changes. We’re gonna do some fun stuff and special stuff,’” Way told CNN. “He said the biggest catalyst to getting the city back is if we win games, and he’s like, ‘I’m gonna get the people in here that I believe can get us there.’ “Everything’s just so intentional and on purpose, and it’s no accident. … It’s just, it’s fun to be a part of.” After a 4-13 season in 2023, the Commanders fired head coach Ron Rivera and brought in Dan Quinn, a defensive mastermind who came over from the rival Dallas Cowboys. With him, Way said, was a change in mentality that has made this season’s Commanders tough to beat. “We just fight and we just try to win,” he said. “We don’t know who’s going to need to make the play. … And it’s not, it may not be cookie cutter, it may not look the same every time, but like the way DQ empowers us, you just always feel like we’re in the fight like and so it’s a very special thing to be a part of.” After a season-opening loss to the Bucs, the Commanders won seven of their next eight games and won five straight to close the regular season. The run brought a surge of sights not seen in the DC metro area in quite a few years: burgundy and gold being worn in public, flying on flags from cars and the block W logo showing up on hats and shirts around the area. “Oh yeah, big time. I think, I think that there’s just so much excitement,” Way said when asked if he’d noticed a change around the area this season. Other players, including ones who’ve played against the Commanders for years and are new to the team, noticed the change too. “Every day since the moment I got here, this place has exceeded every expectation,” said veteran tight end Zach Ertz, who spent nine years on the in-division rival Philadelphia Eagles and is in his first season in the capital. “I had been in this division for a long time, you just kind of heard things that rumblings here and there, and from the moment I got here, it just felt like all those stories were just not any part of the experience that I’ve had.” He added: “I feel like that stems from everything that Josh (Harris) has done, (general manager Adam Peters) has done, with everything DQ has done, and this is honestly some of the most fun I’ve ever had playing football. And just being able to be a part of this team, be a part of this group of guys, has been really, really enjoyable.” Walking around the exterior of Northwest Stadium and the concourses inside, it’s clear to see that the main reason why hope is suddenly surging through this reawakened fanbase is one player: rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels. No. 5 jerseys are everywhere, and his heroics this season have already made him the most popular player in Washington since the last young quarterback who walked onto the field in Landover and made the impossible seem probable. Daniels’ emergence as a playmaking leader appear to have helped inspire a quick turn in fortunes for the Commanders and mean the comparisons with Robert Griffin III, the second-overall pick in the 2012 draft who became a sensation before injuries derailed his career, are perhaps inevitable. It’s not hard to see why – both Griffin and Daniels were drafted at No. 2 and entered the league after winning the Heisman Trophy, the prize for the best player in college football. Griffin, popularly known by his nickname RGIII, embraced the comparisons earlier this season by posting a photo of himself and Daniels side by side on Instagram and writing, “Jayden Daniels will finish what we started and be the Franchise QB the city deserves.” Griffin set the NFL alight in the fall of 2012, making incredible plays with both his arms and his legs. It looked for all the world like Washington had found a franchise quarterback who was going to bring the team back to the heights it had known in the 1980s and 1990s – but all of that came crashing down when the young quarterback blew out his knee at the end of his rookie year. The injuries were themselves a controversy that provided an example of what the team had become – reports circulated that Griffin was rushed back from an injury suffered earlier in the year and was playing in the playoffs before he was cleared. The team also faced embarrassing questions about the quality of the turf at what was then FedEx Field, and whether the torn-up playing surface played a role in Griffin’s injuries. The game against Seattle in the Wild Card round in January 2013 marked the beginning of the end for Griffin in Washington. A player who was once Washington’s great hope instead became part of a painful, extended quarterback controversy that took years to unravel. The pain of seeing RGIII lying on the field, writhing in pain, is never far from Commanders’ fans minds. When Daniels was sacked by the Falcons’ JD Bertrand in the first quarter of that clinching game last month, he was twisted to the turf and his legs buckled awkwardly. The air went out of Northwest Stadium as the crowd gasped and someone in the south end zone seats yelled, “Get up! Get up! Get up!” Daniels did get up and proceeded to show exactly why he’s become the symbol of the franchise’s resurgence this year. Like Griffin, he makes plays with his arms and legs. He’s got a cannon for an arm, as evidenced by the Hail Mary pass to beat the Chicago Bears in late October that traveled more than 60 yards in the air. And, as the Falcons found out in the fourth quarter and overtime, he can boss the game on the ground as well. The overtime drive to beat Atlanta showcased exactly how the rookie sensation can simply take over at the most critical moment. In a methodical drive that won the game, Daniels ran for 42 yards and passed for 32, with the last two yards coming on a short touchdown pass to Ertz that ended the game and sent the burgundy-and-gold-clad fans into hysterics. Daniels ended the game, his last full contest of his debut regular season, throwing 24-of-36 for 227 yards and three touchdowns and adding 16 carries for 127 yards on the ground for good measure. It was enough for Daniels to break Griffin’s record for most rushing yards by a rookie quarterback – something that RGIII welcomed: “I wanted Jayden Daniels to break my rookie rushing record because I’m not about rooting against the next generation. He EARNED IT. He is the FUTURE,” he wrote on X. Quinn said he told Raheem Morris, his counterpart on the Atlanta sideline, after the game: “Man, there’s some things that 5 does that you can’t put on a card.” The Hail Mary to beat the Bears, the final drive and comeback win over the Philadelphia Eagles, the final drive that led to a field goal to beat the New York Giants, the comeback win over the Falcons that sent the Commanders the playoffs – all those moments together have inspired cynical fans to believe that Daniels is the catalyst for a brighter future. “I don’t really have any words,” Daniels told CNN Sport about the fans’ embrace. “You know, it’s kind of crazy just to see my grandfather’s last name around this stadium, and the legacy that he set, and, you know, I’m able to go out there and continue this legacy at even a bigger stage. So, I mean, that’s kind of was a real moment for my family, just seeing Daniels in the NFL, everybody wearing the jersey too. … I’m extremely grateful for that.” From the concourse on Northwest Stadium’s west side, one can just barely make out the dome of the US Capitol and the Washington Monument. Between those landmarks and the Commanders’ home field is the ruin that is now RFK Stadium. The franchise played their home games at the stadium from 1961 to 1996 and there’s been a movement to bring the team back to the district almost since the day they left. Kept in regular use until 2017 when DC United finally moved out, it has been left to rot as the federal government and the DC City Council tried to figure out what to do with the site. After five years, the National Park Service finally said in May 2024 that the stadium could be demolished with no significant impact to the environment. That was a flash of good news for advocates who wanted to bring the team back to DC. But the biggest surge of joy came late last month when lawmakers in Congress passed a bill in the dying hours of the congressional session to transfer ownership of the RFK site from the federal government to the district’s government. “We are extremely grateful that our elected officials have come together on a bipartisan basis to give Washington DC the opportunity to decide the future on the RFK stadium site,” Harris said in a statement. “This bill will create an equal playing field so that all potential future locations for the home of the Washington Commanders can be fairly considered and give our franchise the opportunity to provide the best experience for all our fans.” The lease on Northwest Stadium ends in 2027 and Harris has set 2030 as the target for a new stadium. DC, Maryland and Virginia are all making plays to be the home of a new stadium, but for many here, the RFK site is the sentimental favorite. A return to the site of the team’s greatest glories has long been on the agenda for DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, who wore a Commanders’ beanie at a ribbon cutting for a new recreation center just days after Congress passed the bill transferring the RFK site. “I’m just really happy,” she said as she wrapped up her speech on the new rec center, rubbing the block W on her hat to cheers from the crowd. “I’m happy for a lot of reasons this morning.” Bowser’s look as she celebrated the legislative win was emblematic of the feeling around the Commanders during this turnaround season. Washington fans will hope there are many more satisfied smiles to come as the postseason – and, they hope, a new era – begins to dawn."
‘Money excuse must stop’: Thibaut Courtois urges soccer to use NBA as reference point in calendar congestion crisis,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/31/sport/thibaut-courtois-calendar-congestion-real-madrid-spt/index.html,"It’s a question that’s increasingly at the forefront of soccer’s agenda: is bigger always better? With domestic, continental and global competitions all vying for space in what’s becoming a full to bursting calendar, concerns over player welfare, the tug of war between club and country and conflicts over the direction of the game have never been more pressing. Just ask Thibaut Courtois. The decorated Real Madrid goalkeeper is one of those players experiencing the real-time physical and mental demands of the game. He admits there’s no one size fits all solution; but says one counterargument aimed at his profession must be firmly put to bed. “The excuse of ‘you earn a lot of money’ has to be stopped,” the Belgian told CNN Sport after winning the Player Career Award at the recent Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. “You can also earn money with playing 10 games less. It’s not that (there are) too many games … I feel the problem is that we have a lack of rest.” Boiling point was reached earlier this year when unions representing soccer players launched a legal challenge against FIFA’s “unilateral” decision to set the international match calendar – notably an expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup. Unions say the competition, which is scheduled to take place in the United States next year from mid-June to mid-July, infringes on the players’ right to an annual break, breaching the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFREU) “without any serious justification.” FIFA President Gianni Infantino, though, has defended the calendar. In his opening address to the 74th FIFA Congress in Bangkok in May this year, he insisted world soccer’s governing body is “financing football all over the world.” “The revenues that we generate are not just going to a few clubs in one country, the revenues that we generate are going to 211 countries all over the world. There is no other organization that does that,” he added. But does Courtois believe organizers are listening to the players’ concerns? “No, I don’t think so,” he says. “FIFPRO are trying to protect the players (…) but I think other governing bodies, they don’t think about it. “This Club World Cup is something that has to exist, but it’s just hard to find the right way into it. I think clubs want to help, but we all follow the rules and follow the calendar we get given.” So what is a viable solution to the current calendar predicament? For Courtois, the number of games isn’t necessarily the problem but rather the gap between seasons. An avid basketball fan himself, the 32-year-old sees the NBA as a potential reference point. The world’s dominant basketball league has a demanding schedule for eight months – with 82 regular season games before the postseason where a team can potentially play 28 games – of the year but offsets that with a significant period of rest for its players. “I think (soccer) players will not mind to play nine months non-stop with proper preparation and load management,” he says. “If you have two months off in summer, like (the) NBA, you can rest your body one month and you can train one month. People will be more ready to do nine months fully. When you don’t rest, then it’s when all the injuries pile up. “This year is a Club World Cup, then next year is the World Cup, then the year after something else, so there’s no rest for players.” Indeed, the Real Madrid goalkeeper knows all too well about the toll of fixture congestion. The Belgian returned from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear in March this year which had kept him sidelined for nine months but has suffered a number of injuries since. He’s also seen such pressures exerted on his club teammates. “Jude (Bellingham) and Dani (Carvajal) played until 14th July and, then 1st August, they were at Madrid training, and 8th August, they played (UEFA) Super Cup. If you explain this to people in America with NBA, NFL, they will not understand. “If you play in a team that plays once a week, you don’t understand this problem of the calendar because you have a game each Saturday and you deal with it and that’s how it is … but for us top players, it’s different. “The other day I was laughing with (Federico) Valverde. I said, ‘Your next holidays will be in 2027.’ You know how mad that sounds!” When contacted by CNN for comment, FIFA pointed Infantino’s speech in Bangkok in May, in which he said: “FIFA is organizing around 1% – 1% of the games of the top clubs in the world – 1%. When it comes to the national teams, it’s very, very similar, it’s true. “We increased the number of participants for the (FIFA) World Cup but still it’s one month every 48 months,” he continued. “So, I hope – I hope – that these figures that you can all, of course, check and calculate, show that we should probably stop this futile debate, which is really pointless, and focus on what we have to do, on what our mission is, which is to organize events and competitions, and to develop football around the world because 70% of you, of the Member Associations of FIFA would have no football without the resources coming directly from FIFA.” The Belgium goalkeeper also sees the problem lying not at club but international level with consequential games at every stage placing further importance on valuable squad rotation time. The European Championship expanded from 16 teams to 24 in 2016, the AFC Asian Cup and Africa Cup of Nations expanded from 16 teams to 24 in 2019, the CONCACAF Gold Cup so to from 12 teams to 16 in 2019, while the 2026 World Cup – which will be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico – will go from 32 to 48 sides. Outside of qualifying for the aforementioned tournaments, competitive Nations League matches are now also played in international windows in Europe, North and Central America and the Caribbean. “Definitely, it’s more international games,” he explains. “For example, in the national team with the Nations League, it’s cool to play a small tournament and to win a trophy and it gives smaller teams a chance to qualify for the Euros. I like that. “The problem is that in September, October, November, the best players, top players have to play important games where the coach cannot rotate, cannot try new things. “Every game is so important that now the World Cup qualifier starts, and you have also to do well.” Courtois, though, has currently chosen not to play for the Belgium national team under current coach Domenico Tedesco. The decision came after he was left out of the Belgium squad for the 2024 European Championship following a row with Tedesco last year. With 102 caps to his name, he admits he still holds hope of one day reappearing for this country. “I always feel proud to play for my country,” he explains. “Obviously, the team also moved on, and I don’t know what will happen in the next month, year. “I obviously hope to have another game, to have a proper goodbye or to play again. I would love to play the World Cup … but we’ll see what happens. It’s not so easy.” It’s not only FIFA that has sought to broaden its share of the market. From this season UEFA’s revamped Champions League – the most prestigious competition in European club soccer – now sees teams play at least an additional two games. In a departure from the well-established six-game group stage format, clubs now play eight fixtures in a single 36-team league. It’s a move, though, that Courtois supports. “It’s very similar to some idea proposed by our president (Florentino Pérez) – the Super League – and to what they wanted to do,” he says. “I guess they were right with this new approach because they’ve given a lot of exciting games and you have to fight ‘til the end and, and you don’t know what will happen.” Courtois, along with Vinícius Jr., Bellingham and Valverde, will once again be integral to Real Madrid looking to both defend and add to their record-breaking La Liga and UEFA Champions League titles. Despite criticism following a slow start to this season, Los Blancos already have two pieces of silverware under their belts with victory in the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Intercontinental Cup. They’ll have the chance to add a third trophy when they, along with FC Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Real Mallorca, head to Saudi Arabia in mid-January to play in the Spanish Super Cup. Meanwhile, a victory against Valencia this Friday will see them leap to the top of the La Liga table ahead of city rival Atlético Madrid. “We never prioritize one thing,” he says confidently. “I think the last two Champions League we won; we also won La Liga. “This year, I think everyone can beat everyone in La Liga. It’s a tough competition, and in the Champions League, the same. We just want to win everything possible and that’s also what is demanded of us at Real Madrid.”"
Why are elite-level athletes so into video games?,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/06/sport/sportspeople-hooked-video-games-spt-intl/index.html,"Most points in NBA history. Fourth most triple-doubles. Fifth most three-pointers made. LeBron James is in the conversation for so many records that it is barely a surprise when you hear of another one. That is, until, he reveals that he is one of the top 100 players in the world at the video game Madden NFL 25, as he did in October. “LeBron really is that good at Madden,” his former teammate and fellow NBA champion Channing Frye tells CNN Sport. Video games have been inching their way into the sporting world for years. On December 21, NBC Sports and Peacock viewers were able to watch the Kansas City Chiefs’ 27-19 win over the the Houston Texans on an alternate broadcast which featured elements of Madden NFL 25, such as player ratings and graphics direct from the video game. Two days before that, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson reportedly had turned down the chance to trade for current Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jerry Jeudy in the offseason because of his Madden in-game rating, according to The Athletic. Still, the news that an elite traditional sport athlete might be quite so devoted to a video game is a revelation which subverts the classic, outdated understanding of who sportspeople are: pro athletes definitely don’t play video games that much. It turns out, though, that they do. “I was just really into World of Warcraft, when it first came out,” remembers Frye. “I was on there with Malik Rose, Andrei Kirilenko, Quentin Richardson, (five-time NBA champion) Tim Duncan, myself. We were nerding out! Nerding out. I had an opportunity to play with (San Antonio Spurs legend) David Robinson. So that game was pretty wild.” Frye’s experience with the game is mostly positive, a place for him and other players to hang out and decompress from the stresses of elite-level sport. “Dookiedrawls was (the online handle of) my guy!” he laughs. “I had a snake, and when the snake would bite you, with the graphics it looks like it punches you in the nuts, so I named him D*ckpuncher. So I’d be like ‘Go get him, D*ckpuncher!’ “And then me and my boys, who would play, they would all have inappropriate names for their pets. So we would laugh every single time. You’re getting beaten up by D*ckpuncher, Eye Gouger, Wet Willie!” The crossover between the NBA and the gaming world goes far beyond Frye’s guild and its collection of questionably named animals. “Devin Booker, KD, all those guys are playing Call of Duty,” says Frye. “I think Luka (Dončić) is like a diamond or a platinum (ranking) in Overwatch. I know that Robin and Brook Lopez play Overwatch also. So I would say 75% of guys (in the NBA) play video games.” Former Slam Dunk Contest winner Terrence Ross estimates that the number of players is even higher. “I would say at least 80%,” he tells CNN Sport. “Especially with the NBA getting younger and younger, a lot of these kids are just naturally growing up on the PlayStation, Xbox, whatever it may be.” Ross takes gaming seriously. The former Toronto Raptors, Orlando Magic and Phoenix Suns man has a fully functioning arcade machine in his home office – which he calls his “happy space” – complete with a picture of himself as a superhero on the side. “It’s just me in a cape with a big Superman tee on my chest, looking super dieseled,” he laughs. “It’s not bad!” Such is Ross’ passion that he even took up streaming towards the end of his basketball career. “I had a little kit I used to bring with me on the road that allowed me to stream,” he says. “So I used to bring a duffel case with a laptop, camera, microphone, anything I might need. “It’s one of those things where it’s almost… not another job, but it keeps me active.” Both Frye and Ross take pride in their gaming abilities, but it would not be unfair to say that their achievements are outdone by those of former snooker world champion Neil Robertson. The only snooker player from outside the UK ever to have completed the sport’s Triple Crown – the World Championship, the Masters and the UK Championship – Robertson also spent a number of years competing with the world’s best in World of Warcraft. “I was in one of the top five guilds in the world,” the Australian tells CNN Sport. “There’s not many sportsmen who can say that! “I used to practice (snooker) in the morning and then I’d go to the internet café, and I’d be there for like 10 hours until it closed. The guys absolutely loved me in there!” All three of Frye, Ross and Robertson speak of some genuinely great gaming memories, but also of a point where it just all became too much. “There are a lot of guys in the league that have problems sleeping, just because we are on the road so much, we’re traveling, doing this and that,” says Frye. “And what a video game does is just keep you up. And so I’ve seen guys stay up all night just playing. “I was spending more time on the video game than I was watching basketball. Obviously, I was doing my workouts, but it was like, ‘Would I stay an extra 30 minutes? Ah, no – let me go home earlier so I have 30 minutes to play.’” Frye was able to curtail his relationship with World of Warcraft early enough. “That one got to the point where I was just like, ‘I have to delete my account,’” he says. “That was too much. I literally, in the summertime, wouldn’t leave my room for 24 hours.” Back then, academic research on video game addiction was hard to come by. But, since 2019, the World Health Organization has recognized “gaming disorder” as a health condition. While the former Cavs man stops short of saying that he was ever addicted, Ross is less sure when asked the same question. “I definitely could see it,” he says. “I definitely had a period where it was like, ‘Alright, now my son is like three or four, I can’t play video games for four hours during the day, just like straight after practice.’ I had to mix it up. “But I noticed that it was such a comfort thing for me that I wouldn’t even notice myself just going into my office and just hopping on the game. It was so out of the ordinary. It was such a habit that I had to, like, break it. “It was tough. It sounds ridiculous, but me and my wife used to get into arguments, like, ‘You’re playing the game too much.’ I’m like, ‘No, I’m not.’ But after a while, I started to realize, ‘Okay, I can kind of see it.’” Is it possible to play as much as Frye and Ross and it not have an effect on your performances on the court? “I think it’s almost impossible for it not to,” says Cam Adair, founder of Game Quitters, a support community for people struggling with gaming addiction. “And the biggest reason for that is just that amount of hours, it just doesn’t leave a lot of time for other things. “Are they sleeping as much and recovering as much as they need to? Are they doing the extra training that they need to?” Adair recalls a case where he was approached by the manager of an NFL team who was worried about one of his players. “This player was a rising star, really coming on, and was due for a huge, multi-year contract,” he remembers. “And his manager called me because he was quite concerned about the amount of gaming he was doing. It wasn’t necessarily, yet, affecting his play on the field, but the manager was a little bit concerned about the way it was affecting his downtime, so not spending as much time on his business as he should have been, or on recovery or rest. “This player, his performance started to decline and injuries started to pile up, and actually, he didn’t get that multi-year deal. At the time that deal would have been worth about $14 million a year on a multi-year deal. “It didn’t keep him from playing in the NFL, but this is like, tens of millions of dollars left on the table.” In Ross’ case, the impact on his actions on the court, while subtle, came in the form of wondering whether his real-life performances on the court would affect the rating of his virtual likeness in the video game NBA 2K. “I’m thinking about my percentages more when I’m playing because now I’m like every shot felt like it was a little more… it felt a little heavier, just because I was like, ‘If I have a bad game in real life, I know my guy on 2K is probably going to get a little worse.’ So, like, I’m thinking about that in the back of my mind.” If Ross remains somewhat undecided on whether his gaming represented a habit or an addiction, Robertson does not. “I was an addict for sure. Oh my god, yeah,” he says. “You’re somewhat in denial about it all. You’re thinking it’s not impacting you when it really is.” Robertson’s addiction began when he was about 19 years old, trying to make it as a professional back in Australia. “I remember Diablo II coming out. That was like the first time when there was a bit of a serious problem,” he says. “I remember my mom making an account for herself so she could log in and check on me, to make sure I wasn’t playing during the day, that I was actually going to the snooker club and practicing.” Unfortunately, while Robertson was able to shake off his Diablo II addiction, that game was just replaced by a succession of others throughout the Australian’s career, many of which affected his results on the snooker table. “For sure it impacted my practice, and then that’s obviously going to impact your performances on the table,” he says. “Sometimes I’ve gotten away with it and I’ve actually maintained a really good ranking and still been able to win many tournaments. But there’s other times where I’ve gone off the boil for a few months.” One such time came in the 2013-14 season. “The second half of that season, when I got into FIFA 14, I actually had a big drop off in results because I just was playing this game all the time,” he remembers. “I was going to practice angry because I was losing (at FIFA). It was just horrific. “There would be some days where I’d get so infuriated playing the game that I wouldn’t even go to practice.” Another of Robertson’s addictions was the game League of Legends. “Many years ago, when I’d be playing League of Legends, you know, this game is going on maybe 20 minutes longer than it should have done, but it’s so close,” he says. “Realistically, I should be in the shower getting ready for my match. All of a sudden, the game finishes, I’m quickly running around getting ready. And then maybe I don’t perform as well as I could.” Robertson’s addiction to World of Warcraft even had him blocking out thoughts of deliberately losing snooker tournaments so that he could spend more time gaming. “Our raiding nights (in World of Warcraft) were Wednesdays and Sundays,” he explains. “Sunday is always the day of the final of a snooker tournament, and I remember thinking, ‘Don’t fall into the trap of thinking it’s okay to lose in the semis on Saturday because that means you can raid on Sunday.’” He recalls another incident when he realized the hotel he was staying in for a snooker tournament in China did not have good enough Wi-Fi to play online. “I’d be like, ‘Oh my god, my trip is going to be a nightmare now. I play a snooker match, and then for the other 14 hours of the day, I’m going to be staring at the ceiling with nothing to do,’” he says. “And your subconscious kicks in to where you almost want to get beat so you can just come home.” Having been mostly clean for seven years now, Robertson, who is still playing snooker at the highest level, is able to reflect on what might make professional sportspeople particularly at risk of video game addiction. “I’ve got a very obsessive nature about me, like all top sportsmen do. When I find a hobby that I get really into, if it’s not healthy it can be pretty bad,” he explains. “Everything I do, I do 100%.” It is a sentiment echoed by both Frye and Ross. “I’m very competitive,” says the former. “My son is better than me at Overwatch, so I’m like watching YouTube (for tips). I was just doing that before this interview.” “I think the competitiveness is definitely an aspect that draws a lot of guys to play,” concurs Ross. “Because, at the end of the day, it’s like everything that we do is pretty much a game. You always want to strive to be the best, and whatever it is you’re doing – whether it’s academics, sports, your work – it’s always like that added push of the competitiveness that comes out.” Another element, Ross explains, is the amount of time athletes spend away from home, particularly at young ages. The now-33-year-old says that the time he was gaming the most came “right when I got drafted.” “Because I was still a young kid, coming out of college. I was probably around like 20, 21 maybe. I got drafted to Toronto, so I’m in a different country, pretty much by myself. “I felt I got drafted to a team who was just like, they’re all older guys. It was me and the other rookie that were the youngest on the team, and everybody else had kids and a family and wives and girlfriends. So I was just kind of like, ‘Alright, well, I don’t really have much to do anyway. I don’t have too many creative outlets. I just don’t want to go over to a teammate’s house and, you know, just hop in the middle of his family time.’ “Man, I remember there was some stretches. I didn’t know what else to do,” he continues. “I’d play for a good three, four hours, take a nap, go get something to eat, come back, play another three or four hours, go to bed, wake up, and I’d just be doing that over and over again.” It is a pattern which Adair has seen play out plenty of times. “(One of) the big things that makes them (sportspeople) kind of vulnerable is, first, they have a lot of downtime,” he says. “And that downtime, they almost need to rest. They need to relax and rest and recharge and stay home, stay out of trouble. And when you’re sitting around on the couch, what are you gonna do? Gaming is kind of the thing, right? “A lot of young people are affected because they’re outside their culture, all their friends are back home, it’s a different time zone.” Part of the solution, according to Adair, is to treat video game addiction in the same way teams and leagues treat the more well-known problems that athletes face, like going out to bars and clubs. “Traditionally, there were other activities, and now it’s more gaming, and they need to understand what the impacts are,” he says. “Gaming for that amount of hours has an effect on your brain, it has an effect on your motivation, it has an effect on your overall spirit. “If you really want to be able to perform at the highest level, you need the right training in order to do it. And I think gaming and technology and social media are all within that realm now, as a new frontier that they need to be educated on.” Athletes will continue to look for new ways to compete, or unwind, or talk to friends and family back home. With the proper guidance, video games can help athletes achieve all three of these goals. “Sometimes, having an escape from the real world and finding community is great,” Frye points out. “But you gotta live in the real world for it to be a game.”"
CNN exclusive: Lamine Yamal pledges long-term future to Barcelona after historic 2024,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/08/sport/lamine-yamal-barcelona-future-spt-intl/index.html,"It’s the club where he’s made his name and where he wants to continue writing it long into the future. Lamine Yamal and FC Barcelona is a partnership stretching back to when he first joined the famed La Masia Academy at the age of 7. At 15, the prodigious forward would announce himself to the soccer world, becoming the club’s youngest debutant in La Liga. At 16, he would commit his immediate future to the Blaugrana with an astronomical buyout clause to the tune of over $1 billion. Now at the age of 17, the wonderkid is ready to commit his long-term future to the Catalan giants. “I don’t know when (the contract will be signed), but I believe it’ll be soon,” he exclusively told CNN Sport after winning the Emerging Player Award at the recent Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. “In the end, Barça is the club of my life. I hope to renew my contract with them and to be with them as long as possible. “I want to play in the Spanish league. I want to play for Barça, and yes, I will renew my contract. I will.” In the immediate future, the Barça star is approaching a return to full fitness having missed almost a month with an ankle ligament injury sustained during last month’s shock league defeat to Leganés. It was a blow not only to Yamal – who started the season strongly having made 21 appearances in all competitions, scoring six goals and assisting 11 – but coach Hansi Flick and the team as a whole. Yamal’s absence subsequently coincided with Barça surrendering its lead at the top of La Liga to both Madrid teams, this despite recording its joint best start to a league season with a perfect seven wins from seven games. The Blaugrana, though, have the opportunity to kick start their season in Saudi Arabia this week as they bid to win back the Spanish Super Cup, a trophy they lasted lifted back in 2023. Barça faces off with Real Mallorca in Wednesday’s semifinal with Flick confirming Yamal is ready to play. “It’s true that Hansi is a different coach. The style of play is different,” says Yamal, as he hopes to win a second major trophy with Barça. “We’ve looked to adapt to what he’s told us, and I think we’re doing it well.” “In 2025, we’ll give it our all to win trophies, starting with the Spanish Super Cup and hopefully, it will be the best year of our lives.” To help fulfill that dream year, Barça will be hoping to win back its La Liga crown and make big strides in Europe. Having lifted the league title in the 2022-23 season, the reins were handed back to eternal rival Real Madrid last season. The current season is shaping up to be a race for the ages with Los Blancos, Atlético Madrid and Barça involved in a tight, three-horse race. When asked whether he believes the Catalans will win La Liga this season, Yamal emphatically responds: “Of course. No question. “In the end, La Liga will be won against the teams we’ve previously lost to. I think it’s about focus. We’ve shown in the important moments that we are the best and we’ll continue to do so.” On the European front, a strong showing in the league phase of the rebooted Champions League sees Barcelona currently second in the 24-team standings with two games remaining. At worst, the club is guaranteed a spot in the play-offs, but will be seeking automatic progression with games against Benfica and Atalanta to come later this month. Barça’s last showing in a Champions League final was 10 years ago with a victory against Juventus, as the famed ‘MSN’ trio of Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar guided Barça to a fifth European crown. With his blistering pace, close ball control and clinical finishing, Yamal is already drawing comparisons with Brazilian superstar Neymar. “I was five years old when I saw him at Santos, but seven years old when I saw him in person at FC Barcelona at the Camp Nou,” he reminisces. “It was incredible to see him. Yes, it’s true that (Lionel) Messi was there who was also incredible, but he was something totally different. “Neymar has always been my idol. He’s a star, a football legend.” Despite still being only 17, Yamal has already shown himself to be one of the hottest prospect in world soccer. And if 2023 was a landmark year, it had nothing on an unforgettable 2024. A year that bore witness to historic milestone after historic milestone being passed in devastatingly effortless fashion. Domestically, he became the youngest to score in an El Clásico, feature in a Champions League knockout match and make 50 competitive appearances for Barça. Internationally, Yamal became the youngest ever goalscorer in the European Championships, finalist in the tournament’s competition and – with Spain’s victory – winner of a major international trophy, surpassing the late great Pelé. Even the smiley teenager is taken aback by the speed of his meteoric rise up the Beautiful Game’s ladder. “It’s true that things have happened very quickly,” he says. “I don’t think this is normal for a teenager. I think it’s nice being the first teenager to be doing these things. “In the end, I only think of the future. I only think of the good things that happen and that’s it. As my mother says, ‘Always enjoy the moment because everything goes by so quickly.’” Indeed, Yamal is no ordinary teenager. While the teenager was schooling defenders at last summer’s Euros, he was simultaneously doing his homework as a high school student. A viral clip on social media showed the then 16-year-old studying for his ESO (Spain’s compulsory secondary education) exams: be it solving mathematical equations or honing his English grammar. “I go to class and every day I get different homework,” he told the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) at the time. “Sometimes, they give me more to do at home, but I do it every day. “If they see that we are in the quarterfinals or last-16 (in competitions), they don’t give me a lot of work, but on rest days, when he knows I’m not doing anything, he does tell me to do some bits and pieces,” he said about his teacher. So, did the maestro with the ball also master the Spanish education system? “I passed the ESO (Compulsory Secondary Education),” he tells CNN while smiling. “I was studying and playing, but the whole year has gone well. “Winning the Euros, passing the ESO and now I’m calm. I’m fully focused on football and I’m going to continue in this way.”"
‘MSN reunion? Football is full of surprises’ says Neymar in hint at revival of famed trio as he targets World Cup farewell,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/sport/neymar-msn-reunion-world-cup-brazil-spt/index.html,"Could a revival of one of the most famed trios in world soccer be on the cards? For three seasons, FC Barcelona’s star-studded frontline of Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar dominated the club game. Forging an era of unprecedented success, the iconic “MSN” – as they became known – delivered an incredible 364 goals and 173 assists between them, including a historic treble in their very first season together. Neymar’s move to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record fee in 2017, however, signaled the end for the vaunted attacking force. Messi and Suárez remained together for a further three seasons before the Uruguayan left for Atlético Madrid. The duo, though, reunited in 2024 at Inter Miami while the Brazilian currently plies his trade in Saudi Arabia with Al Hilal. “Obviously, playing again with (Lionel) Messi and (Luis) Suárez would be incredible,” he told CNN Sport after winning the Player Career Award at the recent Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. “They are my friends. We still speak to each other. It would be interesting to revive this trio. I’m happy at Al Hilal, I’m happy in Saudi Arabia, but who knows. Football is full of surprises. “When the news came out that I was leaving Paris Saint-Germain, the transfer window was closed in the United States, so I didn’t have this option. “The project they offered me (in Saudi Arabia) was very good, not just for me but also for my family, so going to Saudi Arabia was the best option.” Suárez will play alongside Messi for at least one more year in the United States after recently agreeing to a one-year contract extension with last season’s Supporters’ Shield winners. Neymar, meanwhile, is contracted in Saudi Arabia until the summer of 2025. There is, though, the prospect that all three could be reunited again on US soil in 2026 as they each seek to lead their countries to the biggest prize in world football: the World Cup. Despite winning the Confederations Cup and Olympic gold, it remains an elusive trophy for the Brazilian and one his country has been desperate to win since its last triumph in 2002. At his maiden World Cup on home soil in 2014, the forward suffered a tournament ending injury in the quarterfinal before the Seleção endured a historic, humiliating 7-1 loss to Germany. Four years later, they bowed out in the quarterfinals to Belgium. Despite equaling Pelé’s official goal tally for the national team, he saw his side bow out of the tournament in Qatar in 2022, this time losing at the same stage on penalties to Croatia. Brazil has so far struggled in qualifying for the 2026 edition of the tournament. The team currently lies in fifth position in the South American table with just five wins to its name in 12 qualifying fixtures – only the top six of 10 nations qualify directly for the finals. Neymar, though, is confident that under the leadership of Dorival Júnior his teammates can navigate the current difficulties and make it to the finals in Canada, the United States and Mexico. “I have a lot of faith in the team, in the players who are emerging, who are young. It’s a young team,” he says. “Today, we’re not in a position where would like to be. “I think together we can achieve something very big. We have a year, a year-and-a-half to work, to do the right things to reach the World Cup.” The 32-year-old’s last appearance in the iconic yellow shirt came in October 2023 when he tore both his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus in his left knee in a 2-0 loss to Uruguay. He made his comeback a year later for Al Hilal before picking up a hamstring injury that would him rule him out for a further period of time. Having missed the first half of the Saudi Pro League this season, the Brazilian is now eager to make up for lost time for both club and country. Does he think he has what it takes to make it back into the national team fold in time for 2026? “I will try. I want to be there. I will do everything I can to be part of the National Team,” says the star with 128 caps to his name. “I know this be my last World Cup, my last shot, my last chance and I will do everything I can to play in it.” The Brazilian’s arrival at Al Hilal in the summer of 2023 followed in the footsteps of global superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema who joined Al Nassr and Al Ittihad, respectively. It underlined the country’s heavy investment in sport and the league’s ambition to be one of the top competitions in the world in the next few years. While game time is something the forward has been hugely short on since joining the Riyadh-based outfit, he agrees with a bold claim made by Ronaldo that the Saudi Pro League had grown so much in stature, superstar status and structure that it has already surpassed France’s Ligue 1. “Today, I think it is,” asserts the Brazilian. “The level of the Saudi Pro League is increasing and, from what I see, it’s better than Ligue 1. Ligue 1 has its positives. The league is very strong. I played in it, so I know this well. “Today (though), the players in the Saudi Pro League are better. Saudi Arabia has surprised me in a positive way. The people, the country, the cities, the culture. I think it’s a country that’s continually growing. It will also host the World Cup in 2034, which I think will be incredible.” Although the Brazilian has experienced several milestone moments in his career, from winning the biggest trophies in European soccer to becoming his country’s all-time record goalscorer, questions have often been asked as to whether the forward has fulfilled the potential that came when he first burst onto the global stage with Santos. With Al Hilal challenging at the top of the Saudi Pro League and in the AFC Champions League elite, a Club World Cup awaiting this summer and a possible World Cup appearance on the horizon in 2026, the forward still has plenty of trophies to play for in his career. So does he believe he’s achieved what he’s wanted to in the game? “Many things have changed. I was a boy. Today, I’m a man. Today, I have a family. I have my sons. “Over the years, I’ve been learning a lot, I’ve experienced a lot of difficulties, but I’ve managed to overcome all of them,” he tells CNN. “I’ve achieved much more than I could’ve hoped for. “I’m very happy with my career, with the things I’ve done, where I’ve played. Obviously, you think about what you could’ve done here and there, but it’s all part of football. You’re never going to win all the trophies. I’m very happy with everything I’ve done to date.”"
Is Novak Djokovic the Greatest of All-Time (GOAT)?,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/sport/novak-djokovic-greatest-of-all-time-tennis-spt/index.html,"Is Novak Djokovic the greatest of all time (GOAT) in tennis? If you look at his accomplishments, the answer should be obvious and yet it still seems to be up for debate. The Serbian star holds 24 grand slam singles titles and needs one more to be clear of Margaret Court, but if he gets to 25, will his critics finally be able to concede that he is the greatest? Don’t count on it. Tennis fans who’ve been spoiled by the unparalleled success of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Djokovic – the so-called Big 3 of the men’s game – over the last 20 years are split, and they are fiercely loyal to the man they each perceive to be the GOAT. Federer was the original. His Swiss swagger made him virtually untouchable early in his career, effortlessly dismantling the legacy of Pete Sampras’s 14 grand slam singles titles and seducing fans with his elegance on the court and his charm off it. Federer dominated the grass courts of Wimbledon – the sport’s spiritual home – transcending the game. Federer would likely be the first name on the lips of most casual fans when asked to name the greatest player; his cultural impact was immense. But then along came Nadal to challenge his supremacy and to build a legacy of his own. The Spanish lefty became the “King of Clay,” setting up residence in Paris to win an extraordinary 14 French Open titles. If Federer was graceful, Nadal brought grit, a more physical style of play that was often unplayable. Federer was the first to win 20 grand slam singles titles, a seemingly impossible feat for anyone who’d watched Sampras get to 14, surpassing Roy Emerson’s record of 12 which had stood for more than three decades. Nadal has racked up 22 major titles, but both have now retired, leaving Djokovic with the stage to himself. Following in the footsteps of two giants was no mean feat, but Djokovic has surpassed them both in every possible way. He’s won 24 grand slam singles titles, the measure by which tennis players are usually ranked in greatness, and in 2016, he became the only member of the Big 3 to hold all four majors at the same time. He’s spent 428 weeks on top of the world rankings, more than double Nadal’s time at the summit and over two years more than Federer managed up there. He’s won the singles gold medal at the Olympics, which Federer didn’t, and he’s won the year-end ATP Finals, which Nadal never did. But it’s in the nine Masters Series events that Djokovic really stands out, neither Federer nor Nadal were able to win all of them, but Djokovic has won them all, at least twice. He totally lapped them! A 25th major, which he will hope to acquire in 2025, is perhaps the only thing left on the to-do list, a trophy that would enable him to definitively say that he won more grand slam singles titles than anyone else. This shouldn’t matter though; Margaret Court won half of her majors in the amateur era, and 11 of her titles came at her home Australian Open at a time when many players didn’t travel Down Under. If it weren’t for circumstance, Djokovic might already have been well past his quarter century. In 2020, until he was disqualified for petulantly hitting the ball at a lineswoman, he was favorite to win the US Open in New York, and his choice not to be vaccinated against Covid-19 cost him a shot at the same tournament and also the Australian Open two years later. These episodes fuel his critics, who find Djokovic harder to love than his Big 3 companions. If his personality doesn’t disqualify him then they would argue that it’s the way he has played the game. Some might argue that Djokovic is too robotic or that he doesn’t make tennis look like it’s fun, discounting perhaps his extraordinary mental fortitude or his instinct for the game that makes him less spectacular – he rarely has to chase down a ball, he’s already there, waiting to hit it. Seven-time grand slam singles champion Mats Wilander once mused that Djokovic was the ‘BOAT’. Speaking with Eurosport in 2023, he was quite clear on who the best of all time was. “I hate the expression ‘GOAT.’ I would have liked to call it the boat race. The best of all time is Novak Djokovic, but when you start saying great, I think more things come into it than just the sport itself,” Wilander said. “But the best of all time? We have him in front of us and it’s Novak Djokovic.” It is possible that Federer was the fans’ first love, Nadal their second, and nobody could have imagined having the GOAT debate again so soon. If two’s company, maybe three’s a crowd. But Djokovic has all the stats to back him up, including a superior head-to-head record against each of his two rivals. Tennis fans will twist themselves into pretzels to argue it any other way, but if the point of being a professional athlete is to win matches, tournaments and trophies, then this debate was really over a long time ago. Whether you like it or not, Novak Djokovic is the GOAT."
‘Giving fate the middle finger’: How blind climber Jesse Dufton scaled a 500-foot monolith,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/sport/blind-climber-jesse-dufton-el-matador-spt/index.html,"As he climbed up the 500-foot rockface El Matador, wedging small pieces of metal into the rock in the hope they would catch his fall, Jesse Dufton was almost entirely alone. Over his own labored breathing, panting and frustrated cursing, Dufton could hear the crackle in his ear of his wife and climbing partner, Molly Dufton, offering assurance and crucial guidance from the ground below. “I got you. Go on buddy, c’mon,” she calmly said through a headset. Calves burning, fingers pulsing, heart in his chest, up Dufton went, scrambling onto tiny handholds and jamming his legs in cracks to move up the sheer wall. Born with a degenerative eye condition called cone-rod dystrophy, Dufton is blind, able to see no more than a “bunch of flashing lights” if he were to hold his own hand in front of his face. But that’s not to say he wasn’t aware of how high he was free climbing on the imposing El Matador on the aptly named Devil’s Tower in Wyoming – the “whizzing” of birds flying underneath his feet and the gusts of wind underneath him provided telling clues, he tells CNN Sport. “On El Matador … I wouldn’t say that I was utterly terrified. Exhausted? Yes. Terrified? Not particularly,” he explains. “My fear level is now more correlated to the amount of danger that I perceive myself to be in. If I can be up high, but if the climbing is easy and I’ve got loads of gear, I am not stressed. I am only stressed when I think I’m going to fall off – and I’m even more stressed when the gear isn’t good.” Though he started climbing aged two with his father, by 11, Dufton had only 20% of his vision. His sight has gotten progressively worse, and now aged 39, Dufton only has light perception. He has climbed the famed Old Man of Hoy in Scotland’s Orkney Islands and also became the first blind climber to establish a multi-pitch route on a 300-foot cliff in Morocco’s Lesser Atlas mountains. It took just a day for Dufton and his wife Molly to climb El Matador, climbing the monolith’s cracks, columns and overhangs to make him the first blind climber ever to achieve the feat. Their journey is documented in the newly released “Climbing Blind II,” available through BritRock Films. Though Dufton had hoped to “on-sight” the route, which means climbing a route with no falls and never having watched another climber complete it – “not a problem for me,” he chuckles – a slip and a fall meant this was off the cards. He admits El Matador was “the hardest route I’ve ever attempted.” But rather than let his lack of eyesight limit him, Dufton continues climbing impressive and technical rock faces, he says, as a way of “giving fate the middle finger.” “I don’t want to have my genetic fate determine my life choices,” he adds, musing that “crossing the road on the way into the office is more dangerous because I can’t see the cars. I have no control over them, I’m literally just listening for them … in an instant you could die. “If you never take any risk, you condemn yourself to the certainty of missing out.” Dufton says that while climbing El Matador, he took “several massive whippers (falls)” but was fine because of preparation and mitigation methods. His wife Molly tells CNN Sport that, once the hardest pitches at the beginning of the route were complete, “It was almost like we were celebrating kind of halfway up the wall. So when we got to the top, I think it’s almost a bit muted. It’s obviously amazing to get on the top.” She adds: “I’ve been climbing for over 20 years myself and I climb to a decent level, but still, some of the stuff he gets up … it’s just insane.” Dufton and his wife have spent the duration of their partnership climbing. After meeting at university 20 years ago, the pair have devised a system using a two-way radio to communicate. He climbs and she belays him on a rope, and vice versa. “If I’m leading the climb, before I leave the ground, Molly will run through the route with me, and the things you’re looking for is to communicate what is the line of the route, and also, most importantly, where’s the first gear (going to be placed),” Dufton explains. “We’ve been doing it for a while, so it doesn’t feel like that unnatural anymore,” Molly says. “It just kind of seems almost normal now, but at the beginning, I think you do feel a lot of extra responsibility. “Obviously, you can’t remember everything, so I just kind of focus on the important bits, like, where there’s a big ledge where he could rest,” she adds. “Once he’s on the wall, you don’t actually say that much. He’s focusing on: ‘I’m kind of feeling the holds out.’” The pair have climbed over 2,000 routes together – and those, Dufton says, are just the ones they have bothered to officially log. “Often people ask us whether or not we argue. No, I think we’re very well-matched. And also, when we’re climbing, that takes up all the focus. It’s a pretty demanding mental activity. You’ve got no space for anything else,” he explains. For his part, Dufton relies on feel when ascending. “You pay attention to the non-visual clues moreso, harking back to feeling the footholds through your shoes. I’m super picky about shoes because that sensitivity is really important to me.” That and endurance, which he describes as his superpower. “My finger strength isn’t that great, but my endurance is incredible,” says Dufton, whose climbing has earned him support from outdoors brands including Montane. However, sometimes, the couple’s system has its limitations. “(Sometimes) she’s way down below, and she just can’t see, so especially on some pitches where you go around the corner or over a roof or something like that, well, the line of sight is blocked,” says Dufton. “She can’t give you any information. That’s a fairly standard occurrence.” As with any high-stakes activity, theirs is a bond built on trust. “In any kind of normal climbing, you are literally putting your life in your partner’s hands because, if you fall off and they don’t catch you on the belay, you know, if you’re high up, you’re going to die,” he explains. “That is a fundamental part of any climbing partnership. “The fact that we are life partners as well, in some ways, doesn’t make that much difference, I think, because you’ve already committed to trusting your life to someone.” Molly agrees: “We’re both really passionate about (climbing), so it isn’t like a drain on one of us. And I almost get more out of watching him succeed than my own climbing.”"
Jayden Daniels: The NFL’s No. 2 overall pick is showing the league that he’s much more than a consolation prize,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/21/sport/jayden-daniels-washington-commanders-profile-spt-intl/index.html,"Almost every choice an NFL team makes has the potential to make a significant impact on an organization’s future. But when it comes to picking a quarterback, a decision really can be ‘franchise-altering’ – for better or worse. This is a fact that the Washington Commanders know all too well. Entering the 2024 season, it had been a long time since the franchise had had any stability, let alone any signs of promise under center. The Commanders have watched long-term investments Robert Griffin III and Kirk Cousins fail to produce any postseason success and have cycled through journeyman quarterbacks like Case Keenum, Taylor Heinicke and Carson Wentz in recent years. So when Jayden Daniels landed in the US capital and injected a shot of life into a tired franchise, fans rejoiced. Selected second overall in the 2024 Draft, Daniels has helped turn the Washington offense into one of the most exciting in the NFL, despite having only played a handful of games. Under head coach Dan Quinn and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, both hired in the offseason, the team appears reinvigorated. Although their year was filled with ups and downs, the Commanders finished the regular season 12-5 and booked their spot in the playoffs where they will face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The leap from college to the pros has not seemed to have fazed Daniels in the slightest. “It would be easy to imagine getting your confidence thrown because it is a jump of a level,” Ben Standig, Commanders writer for The Athletic, told CNN Sport. “We’ve seen none of these issues so far, going back to when they began practicing in the spring. He’s the guy that they talk about that gets there, like, 4:30 in the morning, five in the morning before the vets get there. “He’s very relatable with these guys in the locker room. He doesn’t come across as a diva or anything like that. He’s a teammate, a friend, I guess, to a degree. And you know, then in terms of on the field, he just doesn’t seem to get rattled … week over week, you’ve just seen the improvement.” Daniels has been welcomed with open arms by the Washington fans, something that’s not been lost on the rookie. “I don’t really have any words,” Daniels told CNN Sport after December 30’s clash against the Atlanta Falcons about the fans’ embrace. “You know, it’s kind of crazy just to see my grandfather’s last name around this stadium, and the legacy that he set, and, you know, I’m able to go out there and continue this legacy at even a bigger stage. So, I mean, that’s kind of was a real moment for my family, just seeing Daniels in the NFL, everybody wearing the jersey too. … I’m extremely grateful for that.” Coming into the draft, Daniels was heralded for his dual-threat ability, providing as much threat as a rusher as he does through the air. During his 2023 Heisman-winning campaign, 1,134 of his NCAA-leading 4,946 total yards came on the ground, and he is the only player in FBS history to record 12,000 yards passing and 3,000 yards rushing in their college careers. Though Daniels is a talented runner, rushing ability is not exactly a unique skill anymore. Players like Michael Vick, Russell Wilson and Cam Newton helped to redefine the quarterback position in modern times, showing that there is more to being a QB than pocket passing. Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen are now the faces of a movement that is forcing signal-callers to make plays with their legs on a regular basis. It is becoming a league-wide prerequisite for quarterbacks to be above-average athletes in order for their team to succeed, though Daniels still manages to stand out. “It just seems like he just has such a good feel for what is happening around him that allows him to make these plays,” said Standig. “I think it’s probably almost, maybe more that he’s able to combine the cerebral with the athletic that gives him so much capability out there.” QBs who shine as rushers can often appear raw in the passing game, though Standig argues that Daniels came into the league with that figured out already. “He’s a passer more than he is a runner, and he looks for his guys downfield and eventually finds them,” he explained. “He’s also incredibly accurate with the ball, so he is able to keep his focus on the play itself but still has the ability to take off and run when he needs to, and that’s what puts so much pressure on the defense.” Daniels is fifth among starting QBs in completion percentage and in the top 10 in yards per attempt, showcasing both his accuracy and his ability to create a big play downfield. He has also kept turnovers to a minimum, throwing only eight interceptions through his first 15 games and losing zero fumbles. Maybe one of the secrets behind Daniels’ early success is his unique training regime. To prepare for games, he utilizes a virtual reality system that simulates all elements of a live matchup, from the incoming pass rush to the location of the play clock in opposing team’s stadiums. He began using the system while at LSU. “He says he makes the speed of the plays as high as you can possibly go,” said Standig. “I don’t know if that’s 200 miles an hour, but then when it goes back to normal, or he actually plays the game, it just seems that much slower. “They always say for athletes; when the game slows down, that’s when everything starts to click – that you feel what is happening around you. And clearly, he seems to do that. “It’s fascinating, and the team is embracing it. They are. It’s not something widespread in the NFL. I don’t even know if anybody else is doing it, but they are embracing it and see the benefits of it.” For much of the early part of the season, it seemed like everything that Daniels touched turned into gold. Nothing exemplified that more than in Week 8 against the Chicago Bears. With Washington needing a touchdown to win the game, a handful of seconds left on the clock and Daniels troubled by a lingering injury, the QB launched a 52-yard Hail Mary pass towards the end zone that was tipped by the Chicago defense and somehow found its way into the grateful grasp of Commanders receiver Noah Brown. More than anything else, that play confirmed that things were going to be different in DC this year. After the setting the league alight through the opening half of the season, the Commanders have come back to Earth slightly, suffering a three-game losing streak between Weeks 10 and 12. However, Daniels helped keep the Washington’s hopes of snatching the NFC East crown alive after putting on a stunning late show to down the Eagles in Week 16. Daniels fifth and final touchdown pass of the day found Jamison Crowder in the end zone with six seconds remaining as the Commanders overturned a 14-point deficit heading into the fourth quarter and ended Philly’s 10-game win streak. The Commanders are now in the postseason and will need their budding franchise quarterback to be at his dynamic best, but more than anything, they need him to be healthy. In his college years, Daniels had a penchant for scrambling out of the pocket and putting his rushing ability to good use, exposing himself to big hits in the open field from defenders in the process. With his relatively lightweight frame – he’s officially listed at 210 pounds – concerns over Daniels durability arose prior to the draft. The 23-year-old suffered a rib injury in Week 7 against the Carolina Panthers that visibly hampered him against the Bears the following week. For now, Daniels’ best ability is availability. He will also need to continue to steer clear of the dreaded ‘rookie wall.’ Players that show promise during their first season can often tail off towards the end of the campaign. For example, Daniels’ completion percentage and QB rating have come down from his historic red-hot start though that was likely to be expected. Regardless of how the season ends for Washington, the culture has already started changing in the nation’s capital. “This was the first year that the new ownership group could really put their stamp on things,” said Standig. “It definitely is making people who have been hiding and stopped their fandom and went into caves, start to creep out and they’re like: ‘Is it okay to come back out? Can I really believe in this?’ “The players who’ve been here for a few years, they look as perplexed as a lot of us do.Like, ‘Wait, what’s happening? This is bizarre. We’re winning, we’re having fun.We’re not looking silly.’” It would be unfair to the coaching staff and the rest of the offense to claim that Daniels is solely responsible for the franchise’s rapid turnaround, but the young signal-caller is at the forefront of a revolution in DC, heralding a new beginning only a handful of games into his NFL career."
Costumes and high drama: Darts is now ready to break the United States,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/03/sport/world-darts-championships-us-2025-spt-intl/index.html,"Combining eye-watering accuracy, high drama and a raucous costume party, darts is quickly positioning itself as one of the most captivating sports on the planet. Made popular in English pubs during the 19th and 20th centuries, it has since transformed into a sporting spectacle which draws in fans from across the world and offers its top players lucrative careers. This year’s World Darts Championships concluded on Friday as teenage sensation Luke Littler won his maiden world championship against three-time winner Michael van Gerwen, becoming the youngest ever champion in the process. Yet again, the tournament has proved to be a huge success in several regions around the world, with the 17-year old champion becoming a pop culture icon in the UK. But while an estimated 17 million Americans currently play the sport, darts has yet to break through the already crowded US sports market, with many people still seeing it as a simple bar game. Those who run the sport, though, hope this will change and have grand plans for 2025 and beyond. Eddie Hearn is a name that many Americans might recognize, albeit for another sport. The Englishman is one of the most prominent boxing promoters in the world and regularly helps organize the biggest fights. But Hearn is also chairman of the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC), a body which runs the biggest darts tour in the world, involving the best players. It already has a presence in the US, and it has proven popular. Earlier this year, the US Masters event sold out the Madison Square Garden theater. Hearn expects it to sell out even quicker next year. “I know the (US) sports audience and I know they would enjoy the experience, the atmosphere and the culture of a live darts event,” Hearn told CNN Sport, adding that darts could be as big, if not bigger, than boxing in America. “Now, we are starting to look very diligently at the US market, to the point where we are going to create not just more events but an infrastructure, in terms of building the grassroots and participation levels in the professional game. “The plan would be to have three to four global events in America as part of the global PDC Tour calendar.” Hearn is fully aware that darts can initially be a hard sell to those who don’t understand its true scale. For example, critics still question whether it can be considered a true sport given players are not always in the greatest of athletic shapes and would historically drink and smoke during professional matches. But that tired stereotype stands in stark contrast to the unmatched theater that a pro darts tournament can offer, as players remain ruthlessly precise under the most incredible pressure, resulting in titanic battles which have boosted the sport’s popularity in recent years. If people still need convincing, Hearn says the best thing to do is get them to watch. “It’s just a case of getting exposure in America and just breaking through. We can’t believe how quickly these tickets sell in the UK. It’s just the ultimate night out, fancy dress (costumes), a few beers, live sport. It’s such a good product,” he said. “Once the US starts witnessing the drama and the atmosphere, they’ll be all over it.” While Hearn looks after broader promotion of the sport, it’s left to the likes of PDC’s chief executive Matthew Porter to handle the day-to-day growth. Porter has been in his role since 2008 and has overseen a huge change in how the game is perceived. “What we’ve been able to do over the last couple of decades is expand into territories where darts was well-known anyway, but well-known on a different level,” Porter told CNN. “You can take a dart board anywhere in the world and most people will recognize it. Most people have thrown a dart, whether that be at a fairground, a pub or at home. “So educating people as to what darts is, isn’t really the challenge. The challenge is reeducating them to take the sport from an amateur, participation sport to a professional, audience-based sport.” By simple law of averages, Porter says there should be several players in the US that have the potential to play at a world-class level and it’s now about providing a pathway to help them turn professional. To do so, the PDC supports the Championship Darts Corporation (CDC), a company which runs the darts tour in North America. Peter Citera is chief executive officer and tournament director of the CDC and insists there is already a large number of passionate darts aficionados across the North American market. Canada, for example, has already produced a world champion, with John Part winning the PDC World Championships twice (2003 and 2008). Citera now wants to find the new Part and is confident that darts can position itself as the biggest alternative to the more mainstream leagues in the region, sitting just below the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL. In his 11 years with the CDC, Citera has seen the quality of play increase and, in partnership with the PDC, is now talking to broadcasters to take the sport to the next level. “We are coming,” Citera told CNN Sport. “Our goal is to find the next North American world champion. “We’re really working hard to find that next world champion and it will happen. You’re going to start seeing North Americans making deeper runs on the world stage and all it takes is that one to catch fire.” It’s impossible to analyze the growth of darts and not mention Luke “The Nuke” Littler. The teenage sensation burst onto the scene at last year’s World Championship, reaching the final when he was just 16 and becoming the youngest ever finalist in the process. The English teenager has continued his amazing form this season, becoming the youngest ever world champion at age 17 and helping to boost the reputation of the sport even more. Hearn, Porter and Citera all refer to the “Luke Littler effect” when talking about how much darts has grown in the last year and all agree that an American equivalent would be the golden egg in their pursuit to establish darts in the North American psyche. Three North American players featured in the first round of this year’s world championships, having qualified through the CDC. American Stowe Buntz and Canada’s Jim Long both exited in the first round, while the US’ Leonard Gates won his first match before losing in the second round. Gates notably proved popular with the Alexandra Palace crowd, dancing on stage as he made his walk-up at this year’s tournament. Speaking to CNN, he admits he never thought he would be making a living from the game, having first picked up a set of darts while hanging out with friends at the bar. After coming across the sport by accident, Gates fell in love and started playing every day. He now makes most of his living from the game, balancing his sports career with a small part-time job. When asked why he thinks more Americans aren’t pursuing a career in professional darts, Gates tells CNN that it’s all about changing perceptions, especially in the younger generations – an audience the CDC targets through its junior tour. “I used to hear all the time when playing darts that you can’t make a living playing darts,” Gates said.  “I never imagined I’ll be making a living.” “You have to have that dedication to say, ‘OK, this is what I want to do,’ and take the proper steps to go towards it. You will benefit from it. “I see some of the youngsters (in the US) now that have gotten into it and they came over here to England. They can build from that, whether or not they’re going to stick with it is yet to be seen.”"

The Bay Golf Club – comprised of Ludvig Åberg, Shane Lowry and Wyndham Clark – beat the New York Golf Club – made up of Xander Schauffele, Matt Fitzpatrick and Rickie Fowler – 9-2 over their 15 holes at the SoFi Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The competition, which was delayed for a year, had to wait a few moments longer after Lowry forgot a tee for the first shot of the new format but eventually the Irishman got proceeding underway, blasting his tee shot into the big screen and down the fairway. It was a dominant performance for The Bay Golf Club who quickly raced into a 6-0 lead in front of a packed arena, with Lowry securing the win on the par-five 10th hole as he beat Fowler to make the score 7-1 with five holes left. The whole event was played with smiles on the faces of everyone involved, with players mic’d up throughout to be able to hear the interactions between the competitors. Lowry was inarguably the star of the show after saying numerous humorous lines during the match, including: “I’m going to be the Scottie Scheffler of indoor golf.” The players were introduced in a manner very different to the traditional golf atmosphere, with loud music, smoke cannons and an announcer welcoming the players into the venue like boxers ahead of a fight. There were also plenty of humorous moments to entertain spectators, including when Fowler threw the flag onto the green in front of Lowry’s ball to block his shot with The Bay Golf Club’s victory already sealed. Woods and McIlroy – who co-founded TMRW Sports, the company which came up with the idea of the new format – were both in attendance for the first-ever TGL match, with Woods joining the TGL broadcast at points to express his excitement at the action he was watching and also explain where the idea for TGL came from. “This was just a dream conjured up,” Woods said. “Rory and I were talking about it; it’s hard to believe that dream came into reality and we were able to take golf into another stratosphere, really.” Woods added: “It’s not traditional golf, yes, but it is golf. And that’s the main thing.” After the opening match, many of the players detailed how much they enjoyed the debut of TGL. Lowry said he had “an amazing two hours.” “The last time I’ve had that much fun was probably last September,” he said, referencing his participation in Team Europe’s victorious outing at the Ryder Cup in 2023. Åberg, who was also on that European team, echoed Lowry’s sentiment. “It was awesome,” the Swede said afterwards. “I always said I was so jealous of basketball and football players because they get to do this a lot and we don’t. “So this whole stadium-like feel is awesome to be a part of, and it gets you going a little bit differently from a normal golf tournament.” The second game of TGL takes place on January 14 with the Los Angeles Golf Club taking on the Jupiter Links Golf Club where Woods is expected his make his TGL debut for Jupiter Links."
"‘It’s golf, but it’s reimagined’: Everything to know about TGL, Tiger Woods’ and Rory McIlroy’s high-tech indoor golf league",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/sport/tgl-explainer-tiger-woods-rory-mcilroy-spt-intl/index.html,"After years of anticipation, the high-tech indoor golf league spearheaded by two of the sport’s modern greats is finally ready to tee off Tuesday night. Led by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy, TGL will begin at their custom-built Florida venue, the SoFi Center, and will be broadcast on ESPN having initially meant to start last year. The virtual nature and the 1,500-capacity stadium it will be hosted in is aimed at attracting a younger audience. The venture is the brainchild of TMRW Sports, a company co-founded by Woods and McIlroy. The opening game of the new league sees the trio of Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick and Xander Schauffele of the New York Golf Club take on The Bay Golf Club’s Shane Lowry, Wyndham Clark and Ludvig Åberg. Ahead of Tuesday’s opening match, McIlroy described it as “golf, but it’s reimagined, sort of trying to take golf into the 21st century.” “We have teams, obviously, there’s a lot of technology involved, trying to bring it into the digital era,” he told ESPN. “A lot of things that we’ve taken from other sports like a shot-clock, a timeout, things that you don’t see in regular golf. (We’re) trying to appeal to that bigger sports audience out there.” McIlroy also added that he and Woods have been extremely hands on during the organizational period of their new tournament. “Tiger and I have been a part of this from day one and whenever you see the concepts and the renderings you think, ‘Yeah, that looks really cool,’” McIlroy told ESPN. “But until you actually stand in here (the SoFi Center) and you see what they’ve been able to do, I think the scale of it is the thing for me that blows my mind. “Every time I step in here, I’m just blown away by the size of the screen, the fact that we’re able to put something that looks like golf on a stage like this. It’s really cool and we’re obviously really excited about it within the game of golf. I think a lot of other people outside of the game are going to see this and hopefully get excited about it as well.” Teeing off Tuesday night, six teams comprising of 24 mic’d up stars of the PGA Tour will compete across a 15-match regular season at the 1,500-capacity arena in Palm Beach Gardens before the postseason begins, culminating in a best-of-three Finals Series showdown for the SoFi Cup on March 24. Golfers on each four-player team will hit tee and approach shots into a 64-by-53-foot simulator before moving to the GreenZone; a green that can be uniquely rotated and sloped on each hole thanks to a turntable and actuators under its surface. “The playing surfaces are very realistic,” McIlroy explained. “Whenever you hit it out of the rough, you have to think about whether you’re going to get a flyer (or) whether it’s going to come out soft. A lot of things that you would have to think about on a real golf course.” A single match is contested over two sessions, with each match seeing three players from each team going head-to-head over 15 specially designed holes and two different formats – nine holes of triples and six holes of singles. Triples sees the three players on a team rotate who hits shots as well as taking turns to tee off. The singles format has players matched directly with an opponent, with each player on the team of three playing two singles holes. Each hole is worth one point, a tied hole is worth no points and the team with the most points at the end of the match wins. If the scores are level after 15 holes, a closest to the pin competition will decide the winner. An added element of intrigue is the “Hammer,” which allows teams to double the value of a hole. If it is accepted by the opposition, a hole is worth two points. The opposition team could choose to play the “Hammer” on the same hole making it worth three points but could also use it later in the match. If a team declines their opponents’ use of the “Hammer,” they concede the hole and the points on offer. The makeup of the teams’ various ownership groups makes for a who’s who of sporting heavyweights, with tennis sisters Serena and Venus Williams, NBA stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Steph Curry, as well as Liverpool soccer club owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG), among the backers. Plenty of major winners are littered throughout the players involved in TGL, with both Woods and McIlroy also taking part.

Hideki Matsuyama makes PGA Tour history by shooting 35-under to win The Sentry,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/06/sport/hideki-matsuyama-the-sentry-golf-record-spt-intl/index.html,"Hideki Matsuyama carded the lowest-ever 72-hole score in the history of the PGA Tour on Sunday, shooting an astonishing 35-under to win The Sentry in Kapalua, Hawaii. Matsuyama’s record total eclipsed Cameron Smith’s 34-under at the same event in 2022 as the Japanese star finished three shots ahead of American Collin Morikawa to claim the 11th title of his career. He shot a birdie on the final hole of the tournament at The Plantation Course to seal the record, ending the day with an eight-under 65. “I thought (the record) maybe was 34 or 35, I wasn’t sure, but I kind of thought: ‘If I’m thinking like that, it probably won’t go in,’” Matsuyama told reporters via an interpreter when asked about the final hole. “But it did go in and I’m glad it did.” With the closing putt, the 2021 Masters champion also set the PGA Tour record for the most holes at birdie or better, his 35th of the tournament. The victory, his third in the last 10 months, earned him $3.6 million in prize money. For second-placed Morikawa, who trailed Matsuyama by a shot heading into the final round, his total of 32-under somehow wasn’t enough for the title as calm, windless conditions contributed to low scores across the board. The world No. 4 carded 67 on Sunday, though he may come to regret a front nine that included two birdies and only his second bogey of the tournament on the sixth. Matsuyama, meanwhile, held his nerve with four birdies on the back nine to stay out in front. “He was matching me yesterday shot for shot and I felt like I was playing lights out,” said Morikawa, who carded an 11-under 62 on Saturday. “Yes, you could leave some shots out there, but you shoot 11-under on any golf course and you’re going to be happy. He added: “I just knew I had to be on top of everything and I just kind of let a few slip on that front nine. I played a good back nine, but to win on a course like this, conditions like this, you’ve got to have it for 72 (holes) and I had it for 65.” South Korean Im Sung-jae, who shot a then-joint-record 34 birdies or better on this course last year, was third on 29-under, four shots ahead of Venezuelan Jhonattan Vegas in fourth. Further down the leaderboard, Australia’s Cam Davis and American Will Zalatoris fell foul of a mix-up on the final round, accidentally hitting each other’s balls on the 15th hole. They later went back and played their shots from the correct location, but both players were subsequently handed a two-shot penalty, meaning Davis eventually finished tied for 13th and Zalatoris tied for 26th. It proved a costly error. Without the two-shot penalty, Davis would have finished tied for fifth and taken home an extra $306,625 in prize money, according to Reuters. Zalatoris, meanwhile, would have been tied for 15th and earned almost $120,000 extra."
Christmas dinner injury forces golf’s World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler to miss PGA Tour season opener,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/27/sport/scottie-scheffler-injury-christmas-dinner-spt/index.html,"While Christmas Day is the most wonderful time of the year for many, Scottie Scheffler will remember his 2024 festivities for different reasons. To cap off a roller coaster year for the men’s golf World No. 1, Scheffler suffered an injury while preparing his Christmas dinner and will now miss the start of the PGA Tour’s 2025 season. “On Christmas Day while preparing dinner, Scottie sustained a puncture wound to the palm of his right hand from a broken glass,” Scheffler’s manager Blake Smith said via the PGA Tour on Friday. “Small glass fragments remained in the palm which required surgery.” Smith added that Scheffler has been told he “should be back to 100% in three to four weeks”. But following surgery, the 28-year-old will miss The Sentry tournament, the PGA Tour season-opener in Hawaii. This news is just the latest in a hectic calendar year for Scheffler – on and off the golf course. On the links, Scheffler has been on a streak that most golfers can only dream of. In April, he won the Masters before going on to win gold at this year’s Olympic Games in Paris. In total, Scheffler won seven events on the PGA Tour in 2024, including the TOUR Championship. Scheffler also won the Hero World Challenge and helped lead Team USA to its tenth straight win at the Presidents Cup. It was an equally memorable year off the course for the Olympic Gold medalist. Scheffler and his wife Meredith welcomed their first child on May 8 this year, just over a week before Scheffler played in the PGA Championship. It was during that tournament that Scheffler was arrested, charged with felony assault and released from jail before shooting a stellar 5-under par on day two of the event. All charges against the golfer were later dismissed. Scheffler will be hard-pressed to ever have a more eventful year than he had in 2024, and his 2025 season will now be getting off to a much quieter start after his injury. Scheffler expects to return to competition in mid-January at The American Express tournament at La Quinta, California, according to Smith."
‘It’s a very different beast’: Rio Ferdinand calls for ‘long-term thinking’ amid turbulent times at Manchester United,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/30/sport/rio-ferdinand-manchester-united-globe-soccer-spt/index.html,"Rio Ferdinand knows first-hand the weight of expectation that comes with donning the iconic red colors of Manchester United. Formerly the world’s most expensive defender, the former England international lifted six Premier League titles, the Champions League and two League Cups during an illustrious 12-year spell at Old Trafford. Those were the days when United dominance was par for the course; the reality now, though, couldn’t be any more different. The Red Devils currently languish in the bottom half of the league table with few immediate signs of improvement since the appointment of Rúben Amorim a mere six weeks ago. Ferdinand, though, is calling for calm heads and a patient, holistic approach amidst the chaos. “It’s got to be long-term thinking now,” he told CNN Sport after winning the Player Career Award at the recent Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. “It’s weird to say this of Manchester United, but I just don’t think we can put targets on things. We’re not in a position to do that. “We have a lot of rebuilding of players individually, of a team, but also of a culture and environment. “That’s going to take time, so to put a target above that in terms of position and winning things … takes away from all of those four things that need building.” The team in charge of spearheading this renewal project is the combined force of the aforementioned Amorim and the soccer operations arm of the club, INEOS. Both have staked their reputations to help reverse the United’s stark decline in fortunes in the post-Alex Ferguson era. For Amorim, who arrived in England as one of the most coveted managers on the European continent, the question is whether he can make the step up in quality, stakes and profile. For INEOS, they will be judged by the decisions taken on the pitch and in the boardroom – decisions that, so far, have proven to be divisive among the fan base and pundits alike. United’s new CEO Omar Berrada has already laid out a three-year plan that, in his eyes, would culminate in the Red Devils lifting the Premier League trophy again in 2028 to coincide with the club’s 150th anniversary. That dream currently looks to be further away than ever. “We need to give INEOS the chance to prove that they are capable of dragging the club from where we are,” Ferdinand explains. “They’re now making decisions and their decisions are going to be judged. “What he’s (Amorim) done with Sporting… (He) changed the narrative of that football club for a few years. But also his charisma and his ability to communicate has been very impressive and it was before he came. “It’s alright doing that at Sporting. It’s a very different beast at Manchester United. “In 2025, I hope Manchester United become a positive football club with positive energy around them, and the narrative isn’t always dejected disappointment.” One club that United could take an example from at this moment is historic arch-rival Liverpool. Questions were raised as to whether Jürgen Klopp’s successor, Arne Slot, could follow in the footsteps of one of the most successful managers in the club’s era. Those doubts, though, have been silenced in spectacular fashion so far this season with the Dutchman leading the Merseyside outfit to both the top of the English Premier League and UEFA Champions League tables, winning all six games in the latter. So how does Ferdinand view the clubs’ contrasting approaches to succession planning? “It’s a lot of confusion and noise over (Manchester United) compared to a very seamless, quiet kind of approach (at Liverpool),” he says. “(It) shows you the importance of the infrastructure behind the scenes, but also don’t forget that (the Liverpool) squad was a much more stable squad as well. “A team of people who have won at that club, (that) have been there for a long time. They had the components in there that were working but just wasn’t maybe working the right way and needed fine tuning. “I always look at it as (Manchester) City winning – ‘That’s a nightmare’ – or Liverpool going to be winning this year, ‘It’s a nightmare.’ … I can suffer that over there a little bit if we’re starting to move and go in the right direction.” With Manchester United not even in the discussion for title contention and local rival City enduring its worst ever spell under Pep Guardiola, current logic and form would dictate the title could be Liverpool’s to lose this season. “I don’t think City can turn it around to win the league this year,” says the former defender. “I thought City would win it again (and) Arsenal would run them close, but I think Liverpool have come out of the traps fast. They’ve got a consistency that no one seems to be matching at the moment, so they’re a team to beat.” Continuity within Liverpool’s playing squad is in stark contrast to United’s approach, with Amorim not being afraid to wield the axe – chief amongst those impacted is homegrown player Marcus Rashford. Since being frozen out of the first-team squad, the England international has recently hinted that his days in Manchester may be numbered. Ferdinand, though, isn’t sure it’s the right decision. “Only time will tell with that,” he says. “He’s probably over-scrutinized, unfortunately for him, but that comes with the territory of Manchester United and being one of the bigger players there. “If you’ve got an image that’s up here then you’re going to bring more pressure. I hope that he as a person, more importantly, doesn’t come out of this too damaged because I think it’s been a lot to take on his shoulders as a player. “If there’s a glimmer of hope with this manager, then I think he’ll give Marcus the opportunity. But every manager has big calls – it’s just they’re bigger at Manchester United.” Big calls and big personalities are the nature of the beast at United. Ferdinand has been privy to witnessing and playing with some of the greats of the game during his trophy laden career; perhaps none more so than Cristiano Ronaldo. The two lined up alongside each other at United on 221 different occasions between 2004 and 2009. That era would propel the Portuguese wonderkid to global stardom. A fabulous tally of 118 goals sealed a move to Real Madrid where he would continue his ascent to the pantheon of all-time greats by netting 450 goals. When Ferdinand announced his retirement from the game in May 2015, Ronaldo was still racking up his goal tally, adding 101 at Juventus and a further 27 during his second spell at United. Now plying his trade in Saudi Arabia, the goalscoring machine is yet to stop, even as he approaches his 40th birthday in February. “It’s crazy. It’s wild (what he does),” Ferdinand says of his former teammate. “He’s a great example to all these young players of what it takes: the discipline, the commitment, the sacrifice it takes to get to the top, but more importantly, stay there.” And it’s not just domestically where Ronaldo reigns supreme. With 135 goals in 217 matches and counting, the leading goalscorer in men’s international soccer shows little signs of slowing down. With European qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup set to begin in March, Ferdinand would relish the opportunity to see one of the sport’s all-time greats once again appear on the biggest global stage. “For what it would mean and the narrative, I think, yes,” says the former England captain. “Him and (Lionel) Messi are the two main genuine superstars still playing. “I think it would be very difficult to get two like that, especially in the same era, to do what they’ve done for so long at that level. Vinícius (Jr.), Kylian (Mbappé), Jude (Bellingham), Lamine (Yamal) now, (Erling) Haaland they are the next ones … I think (Jamal) Musiala’s got a chance of being (a part of) that.”"
Saudi Arabia officially announced as the 2034 World Cup host. Human rights groups warn of ‘unimaginable human cost’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/11/sport/saudi-arabia-2034-world-cup-fifa-bid-spt-intl/index.html,"Global soccer governing body FIFA has officially announced the hosts for the next two men’s World Cups. However, the outcome was no surprise. That’s because there was only one bid each for both the 2030 and 2034 tournaments – Spain, Portugal and Morocco have been named joint hosts of the World Cup in six years’ time, whereas Saudi Arabia has been awarded the 2034 edition. While both bids have come under scrutiny during the bidding process, it’s the latter which has caused the most controversy. Michael Page, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch (HRW), recently warned of an “unimaginable human cost” to hosting arguably the world’s biggest sporting event in Saudi Arabia. It comes as several human rights groups warn of issues – including the abuse of migrant workers, freedom of speech and the rights of minority groups – in the Gulf nation. But what is FIFA saying? Why is Saudi Arabia so set on hosting the event? And what, if anything, can be done to make the tournament as safe as possible? To understand the issue, one must first see it in a wider context. Saudi’s bid for the World Cup is not a simple one-off, but part of a wider push to invest in sport. Through its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia has invested billions into changing the landscape of sports, such as golf, boxing, esports and Formula One in recent years. The nation claims the investment is part of Saudi Vision 2030, a project driven by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the economy and situate Saudi Arabia as one of the world’s leading countries. Its focus on soccer, perhaps the world’s most popular sport, has been particularly notable. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has purchased a storied soccer club – English Premier League team Newcastle United – and convinced a host of legends to join the Saudi Pro League – most notably Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Neymar Jr. In the process, the Saudi crown prince, widely known by his initials MBS, has struck up a public friendship with FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who has continued to welcome investment from the Gulf nation in the sport. Hosting a World Cup, then, is the cherry on the top – the pièce de résistance of the Kingdom’s foray into the sport. Unsurprisingly, the country has big plans for the tournament. It has committed to significant infrastructure projects, in addition to building or renovating 11 stadiums and 185,000 new hotel rooms. But, according to human rights groups, the Saudi World Cup in 2034 will come at a cost. A recent report from HRW, titled “Die First, and I’ll Pay You Later,” argues that Saudi Arabia is using the tournament to “wash away its poor human rights reputation.” The report primarily focuses on the treatment of migrant workers, who HRW says will bear the brunt of building Saudi’s World Cup dream. Many migrant workers still exist in the “Kafala” sponsorship system, which ties people to a specific employer. HRW said in a June statement that employees are “vulnerable to widespread abuse, including contract substitution, exorbitant recruitment fees, non-payment of wages, confiscation of passports by employers, and forced labor.” Despite a series of reforms announced by Saudi Arabia in recent years, employers “still hold disproportionate control over workers,” HRW said. There are also concerns about press freedom, the treatment of LGTBQ+ groups and the rights of women, among others. In a recent report published by FIFA which evaluated Saudi’s bid, the human rights risk was categorized as “medium.” The report and designation are based on information provided by AS&H Clifford Chance, a law firm based in Riyadh which was tasked with providing an independent human rights assessment. In its report, FIFA added that “there is a good potential that hosting the competition could help contribute to positive human rights impacts in the context of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.” It also noted “considerable work and level of concrete commitment demonstrated by the bid and its key stakeholders, together with the demonstrable rate of progress and the 10-year time horizon are mitigating factors to consider.” Lina al-Hathloul, Head of Monitoring and Advocacy at ALQST for Human Rights, questioned the assessment’s legitimacy, citing that no independent human rights organization has been able to work in Saudi Arabia, in relation to the bidding process. Al-Hathloul has experienced first-hand how brutal life in Saudi Arabia can be under MBS’ rule. Her sister was jailed in 2018 for leading a women’s rights group and remains under a travel ban, unable to leave the country. It’s been seven years since al-Hathloul, who has left the country, has seen her family, she says. “Saudi Arabia is a pure police state, ruled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with no checks and balances,” she told CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies. “He has arrested people for tweets, the executions have risen to an unprecedented number. This year, a record has been broken in Saudi Arabia’s history – 300 people have been executed. “Human rights defenders are put behind bars just because they advocate for women’s rights, we have seen an unprecedented level of torture and sexual harassment in prisons. My family is under an illegal travel ban just because they are a family of a women’s rights activist. “Every country violates human rights, no country is perfect, but I think it’s about red lines. Saudi Arabia, under MBS today, has crossed that red line.” CNN has reached out to Saudi Arabia for comment. In its report, Clifford Chance says the assessment was produced in six weeks. “As a function of this time frame, it is based on desk research and engagement with the Ministries identified,” it said, referring to Saudi’s Human Rights Commission, the Authority of the Care of Persons with Disabilities, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Sports. “The assessment process did not involve engagement with external stakeholder/ rightsholders. In taking account of published commentary, we have focused on observations by respected monitoring bodies responsible for interpretation and monitoring implementation of the Instruments.” Human rights groups have also criticized Saudi Arabia and FIFA for not ensuring positive change. HRW urged FIFA to postpone any announcement that the World Cup would go to Saudi Arabia “until migrant workers’ and women’s rights, press freedom, and other human rights are protected.” It also called on the governing body to press Saudi Arabia to “engage with human rights stakeholders and allow independent human rights independent monitoring within the country.” Meanwhile, Amnesty International has also called on FIFA to “halt the process” of awarding Saudi the tournament “unless major human rights reforms are announced.” In a statement to CNN, FIFA said it is “implementing thorough bidding processes for the 2030 and 2034 editions of the FIFA World Cup, in line with previous processes for the selection of hosts for the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 in Australia and New Zealand, the FIFA World Cup 2026 in the United States, Mexico and Canada and the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 in Brazil.” Saudi Arabia has received plenty of criticism for its human rights record before and has previously resisted allegations of “sportswashing,” which involves countries using high-profile sporting events to project a favorable image of their nation worldwide, often to shift attention away from alleged wrongdoing. In an interview with Fox News that aired in 2023, MBS said he doesn’t “care” about the country’s investments being described as sportswashing, as long as it’s “going to increase my GDP by one percent.” Earlier this year, though, the head of Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup bid, Hammad Albalawi, said the country had made strides in terms of human rights in recent years. “We have come a long way and there’s still a long way to go. Our principle is to develop something that is right for us. Our journey started in 2016, not because of the World Cup bid,” Albalawi told Reuters. For many soccer fans around the world, such conversations will feel familiar from previous World Cups in both Russia and Qatar, with both posing issues around human rights. The closest parallel, perhaps, is with the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, a nation which also received heavy criticism for its treatment of migrant workers. Qatar hit back at claims of sportswashing and said it would use the spotlight of the World Cup to help push the country forward. In 2023, FIFA told CNN it was “undeniable that significant progress has taken place” in the country, and that the tournament was the “catalyst for these reforms.” However, Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s Head of Labor Rights and Sport, says that FIFA learned the wrong lessons from two years ago. “My fear is that the lesson they’ve learned from Qatar is that they can ride out the criticism. They can ride it out and prioritize the bigger political and financial goals that they’ve got,” he told CNN’s Davies. Cockburn added that a tournament such as the World Cup could hold the power to bring about positive change, but only if the intentions are genuinely there to do so. He, like many others, was pleased that FIFA became the first global sport’s body to include human rights in such a bidding process in 2017 but has been disappointed by how it’s been implemented. “When (FIFA) is awarding what is the world’s biggest sporting event – the most watched, the most visited – it has a responsibility to make sure it’s not causing adverse impacts to workers, to fans, to activists and to journalists,” he said. “(FIFA) said that itself, it simply needs to live up to its own commitments and values. It’s not adhering to those standings while it’s pretending that it is. That’s a really harmful façade. We’ve had a predetermined process here.” He adds: “When it’s a choice between a World Cup in Saudi Arabia, or its human rights policies, it’s chosen a World Cup in Saudi Arabia.” Al-Hathloul, meanwhile, remains optimistic that things can still change in Saudi Arabia, saying the country’s people deserve to enjoy a World Cup, while conceding that the opportunity has been tarnished by the process. She says FIFA has been “complicit” in engineering a situation whereby Saudi has faced little competition, and therefore had no incentive, to actually improve human rights. “In order for change to exist, you have to challenge, you have to question, you have to speak about what is going on in the country,” she said. “We have 10 years now, we have 10 years to encourage people to speak, we have 10 years to really challenge and question and push for positive change. “Usually, what happens is that people have accepted Saudi money in exchange for their silence. I do hope in the coming 10 years that things will change, but people have to be braver than this.” CNN has reached out to FIFA on the above allegations."
‘Nobody has seen it before’: Arsenal held to 1-1 draw at Brighton after conceding controversial penalty,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/05/sport/arsenal-brighton-penalty-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was left lamenting a controversial penalty decision on Saturday, the likes of which he said he has “never seen,” and which consigned his team to a 1-1 draw at Brighton. The penalty was awarded in the 58th minute when Arsenal defender William Saliba seemed to accidentally headbutt Brighton forward João Pedro as they both jumped to head the ball. The Video Assistant Referee agreed with the decision, confirmed it was a penalty and Pedro converted from the spot to level the game. For Arteta, however, the decision was “very disappointing.” “I have never seen a decision like this in my career. I asked the boys if they have and nobody has seen it before,” he told reporters after the game. “When you look at the incident, the distance, the player, João (Pedro) touching the ball, Saliba touching the ball, you can see contact there.” Letting slip a 1-0 lead and securing only a draw dealt a blow to Arsenal’s Premier League title hopes as the Gunners now sit five points behind league leader Liverpool, which has two games in hand. But for Brighton manager Fabian Hürzeler, “it was a clear penalty.” “If it happens with another piece of the body, for example knee-to-knee, it’s just too late, so it’s just the fact that it’s too late,” he told reporters. “I can’t understand to say it’s not a penalty.” The debate over whether the penalty should have been awarded rumbled along among the pundits too – Gary Lineker said on BBC’s “Match of the Day” that “never ever have we seen a penalty given for head clashes,” while Jamie Redknapp said on Sky Sports that it was “absolutely” a penalty. When asked if he expected the penalty to be overturned, Arteta said: “I checked and after three seconds they said they already checked it. It seems quick.” He added that the referee Anthony Taylor told him he would take a look at it."
"Lily Yohannes: The 17-year-old star of the US women’s team, by those who know her best",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/04/sport/lily-yohannes-uswnt-teenage-star-spt-intl/index.html,"At just 17, Lily Yohannes has the soccer world at her feet. Considered one of most exciting talents in the women’s game, she is already a regular in Ajax’s first-team and is making waves on the international scene. The teenager recently gave the US Women’s National Team (USWNT) an early Christmas present, having opted to represent her country of birth at international level – she was also being courted by the Netherlands. In Yohannes, the US has secured itself a true star in the making. Her effortless ability to glide around the pitch – and distinct eye for the spectacular – has demonstrated a talent way beyond her tender years. But her rise to the top of the women’s game has been no accident, and it’s only just getting started. Before the recognition and media attention, Yohannes was just like any other girl growing up in the US, according to her father, Daniel. Born in Virginia as the youngest of three siblings, Yohannes followed her older brothers into the world of soccer and became totally hooked by the ‘Beautiful Game’ by the time she was three. Speaking to CNN Sport, her father recalls Yohannes playing soccer with her brothers in the basement of the house, which he had converted into a small pitch with goals at either side. It was there that the youngster started to develop her competitiveness. “She just always wanted to be the best and what she does,” her dad said, remembering how she would cry when she lost to her brothers at anything. “As the youngest sibling, her brothers kind of pushed her around, challenged her, you know, gave her that tough love, in a way. “Just kind of shaping that mentality for her to be more, you know, competitive and physical.” Yohannes needed not look far for a soccer role model. Her grandfather played internationally for Ethiopia and became somewhat of a legend after scoring a goal from the halfway line during a match against Ivory Coast in the 1968 Africa Cup of Nations. Yohannes’ father also enjoyed playing casually and he passed his passion for the sport onto her two older brothers – both of whom are trying to forge a professional career. Growing up, Yohannes became embroiled in the family passion, becoming somewhat of a student of the game. She would wake her dad up early in the morning to watch European games on the television and it wasn’t long before she graduated from the basement, and started playing on a real pitch. When she was around five, her dad remembers how she was simply “unstoppable” and would be “dominating” the girls at her age. In search of competition, he tried to sign her up to an older age category because she was just “too good.” During the registration process, though, he was told the club wouldn’t usually let the girls play in older age categories. After just one trial, though, Yohannes was accepted to play with girls three years older than herself. “She was really doing great things. The coaches really liked her and gave her a lot of props. They won championships and tournaments,” her dad told CNN, looking back fondly. Throughout those early years, either he or Yohannes’ mother would film her matches and provide feedback sessions – a service he also provided his sons. “I’m a father but also a trainer. I have to give you my feedback,” he said. “I didn’t really hold back then and nothing has really changed today. The difference now is that they’re playing at a higher level, and the clubs make the video recording. I don’t have to record it.” When Yohannes was just 10, the family decided to pull up stakes and move to the Netherlands. The move was driven by a desire to expose the children to a different culture and broaden their perspective. There was also a job opportunity for her dad, so the decision was made to move, initally temporarily. Another benefit of the switch to Europe was the deep soccer culture which is so firmly embedded in the fabric of the Netherlands – forged by the likes of legendary Dutch player and manager Johan Cruyff, who left such an indelible mark on the game Yohannes quickly began playing with an amateur boys team called WV-HEDW, a team based in Amsterdam. Speaking to CNN, WV-HEDW’s current girls team coordinator Dennis Jullens said Yohannes took a season to adapt to the increase in physicality, but then quickly began to establish herself. “I would say she was above average in a boys team,” Jullens said, speaking about her second season. “We tried to have girls play in boys’ teams, but eventually, the physicality just makes it more difficult. She didn’t have any problems with that. “She stood out, not only because of her footballing skills, but also the way she played. It wasn’t like she was lurking in the background. She was a dominant player among the boys. “Her style of playing is very much, ‘You might think I’m young and I’m a girl, but I will show you what I can do.’ I think that was basically her attitude which still shines through in how she plays today.” WV-HEDW is a partner club of Ajax – it’s based where the old Ajax stadium used to stand – so the Dutch giant was the natural next step for Yohannes. After joining the club’s academy, she worked up the ranks and earned her first contract with the senior women’s team in 2023. She made an instant impression in her debut season, being named the women’s winner of the Johan Cruyff Award – given to the most talented youngster in the Dutch league. During her first season with the senior team, Yohannes struck up a close bond with teammate Ashleigh Weerden – who has since signed for English side Crystal Palace. The pair became good friends off the pitch and occasionally shared a room while traveling together with Ajax. “I just felt like her big sister, telling her to close the blinds or to turn off the lights,” Weerden, 25, told CNN Sport. “When you’re off the pitch with her, she just likes making TikToks. She likes to dance … we played hide and seek in the hotel. It just made me realize, she’s actually just 16, but in the way she plays football, she’s not 16.” Weerden still remembers Yohannes’ first training session with the team. She had heard about her performances in the youth side, but was still surprised at just how quickly the youngster adapted to the professional game. “She was good. Like you could see right away that she has a big talent,” Weerden said about her first time seeing Yohannes train. “Her technique was amazing, the way she feels the game. I didn’t expect that because she was obviously very young, so I was just surprised that she was so mature. “She’s also very tall already, so she was already very strong and would do well in duals. You just couldn’t get the ball from her.” Despite Weerden moving clubs earlier this year, the pair are still in regular contact and message almost every day. While not wanting to put any more pressure on the teenager, Weerdan thinks her friend and former teammate is destined for the very top. “I always told her to just try to be yourself for as long as possible, and try to stay humble, try to just let your feet do the job,” she said. “She’s always done that, and if she keeps doing that, then I think she’ll go really far.” This season, Yohannes has continued to develop and has played in all eight of Ajax’s league matches, scoring three goals and providing one assist. For her family, it’s hard to keep up with the rapid rate in which she is climbing the women’s game, but her father says he is just “really grateful” his daughter is being allowed to flourish at Ajax. Given her performances at club level, it’s no surprise that both the Oranje and USWNT were keen to tie her down. Earlier this year, Yohannes was called up for the US women and made her debut in a 3-0 win against South Korea in June. The youngster, then only 16, scored within 10 minutes of coming on. It was further proof that she belonged at the highest level and, after months of courting, she eventually announced her decision to commit to the US in November. “After much consideration, I have decided to commit to represent my country, the United States. The US is my homeland, my birthplace, and where my extended family resides,” she wrote on Instagram. “These strong connections have driven me to honor my roots and proudly commit to US Soccer. I am excited and eager to continue putting in the work and earn my place on the team.” USWNT’s head coach Emma Hayes was delighted by Yohannes’ decision but warned against putting too much expectation on the teenager’s shoulders. It’s hard, though, not to imagine the midfielder being a pivotal part of the project as Hayes looks to rebuild the Olympic champion to its former glory. Yohannes was called up to USWNT’s two latest friendlies. While she was an unused substitute agai﻿nst England on Saturday, she came on as a second-half substitute against the Netherlands on Tuesday. As if to underline her potential importance to the project, she was involved in the buildup of her team’s winning goal less than five minutes after being introduced to the match. For Yohannes’ family, though, the focus is on keeping her feet firmly on the ground, as her profile continues to rise. “Things move really fast, and you know, we are incredibly proud of Lily’s accomplishment at a very young age,” her dad Daniel said. “We’re always mindful that football is a process, and there’s no real shortcut to reaching the top. Everyone has to put the work in to reach their full potential.”"
Aryna Sabalenka begins quest for third consecutive Australian Open title with win over American Sloane Stephens,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/sport/aryna-sabalenka-australian-open-sloane-stephens-spt-intl/index.html,"World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka began her Australian Open title defense by defeating Sloane Stephens 6-3 6-2 in the first round on Sunday. The Belarusian, who is seeking to become the first woman since 1999 to win three consecutive Australian Open titles, easily dispatched her American opponent before celebrating with a dance during her on-court interview afterwards. Inspired by Sabalenka’s tradition of posting dances on TikTok at the Australian Open, interviewer Jelena Dokic encouraged the three-time grand slam champion to lead the crowd in a dance. As the crowd clapped and music blared, Sabalenka overcame her embarrassment and showed off her dance moves before attempting to take a picture with her Polaroid camera, only to realise the film had run out. “I’m super happy to be back. I love this place and … wow, we have a full stadium, I couldn’t dream for more,” the 26-year-old said. “It was a tough match. I don’t feel like I played my best probably but I’m glad that I managed to close this match in straight sets. It definitely feels like home.” At first, Sabalenka simply overpowered Stephens, often leaving the American stranded so that she could only watch balls fizz past her on the baseline and broke her twice to race into a 4-0 lead. The first three games took just seven minutes and it seemed as if Sabalenka would quickly wrap up the match. But Stephens stepped up, showing glimpses of the qualities which made her a US Open champion, and unleashed a crosscourt forehand winner to bring up her own break point. She converted that to gain a foothold in the set, held serve, and then broke Sabalenka again to make it 4-3. But Sabalenka snuffed out any hope of a comeback when she broke Stephens again in the longest game of the match and then held her serve to take the first set. “I think I kind of stepped back after a few games didn’t go well,” she said afterward, per the WTA. “I stepped back, and I give her a chance to come back in the match. I’m glad that in that game on 4-3 I stepped in and I was going forward to the net. I think that was the key to get back to this match.” The second set began in a similar fashion as Sabalenka took the early lead and tightened her grip on the match with a double break soon afterward. This time, Stephens could not muster a comeback and Sabalenka held her serve to secure the second set, and the match. Sabalenka will face Spain’s Jéssica Bouzas Maneiro in the second round as she aims to become the first woman since Martina Hingis between 1997 and 1999 to win three titles in a row in Melbourne."
Australian Open: Is it Coco Gauff’s time to shine Down Under?,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/sport/australian-open-preview-coco-gauff-sabalenka-swiatek-spt/index.html,"Given everything she has already achieved in her fledgling career – and the weight of expectation she has borne as one of tennis’ rising superstars – it’s sometimes easy to forget that Coco Gauff is still only 20 years old. Heading into the Australian Open, which runs from January 12 to 26, the American is in the form of her life. After winning the prestigious season-ending WTA Finals in November for the first time, Gauff kicked off 2025 with an undefeated week in both singles and doubles to lead the USA to a second United Cup title in Australia. Crucially, too, she appears to have ended her Iga Świątek jinx; Gauff won just one of her first 12 matches against the Pole on tour, but has now earned consecutive victories over Świątek at the WTA Finals and United Cup. Gauff hired Matt Daly, a renowned grip specialist, as her new coach in September after parting ways with Brad Gilbert and has significantly improved both her forehand and serve, two shots that had at times contributed to a poor run of results last season. The 2023 US Open champion, currently the world No. 3, said during the Wuhan Open in October that “there are changes happening” with her grip – and she is already reaping the rewards of that work. Eurosport tennis expert and former professional Laura Robson said that Gauff’s grip alterations have “transformed her game.” She added: “With the forehand, it’s not breaking down like it used to and it doesn’t feel like a weakness anymore and she’s so hard to pass because her movement is the best in a game. “I would say that Coco’s all of a sudden, from where she was in the summer at the US Open, a completely different player and now among the favorites for a slam title again.” Of course, the sample size for her new grip is small and it remains to be seen how it will hold up across a season when faced with a variety of conditions, surfaces and opponents, but her early success has led bookmakers to insert Gauff as second favorite to win the Australian Open above Świątek and below only two-time defending champion Aryna Sabalenka. “There’s a lot of talk about Coco Gauff and her serve and her forehand, where is she going to go? Should she play aggressive tennis? Should she be scrappy and get the ball back and play?” seven-time grand slam singles champion Mats Wilander told Eurosport. “Obviously, there needs to be a combination of the two, but I think that we don’t understand the physical ability of Coco Gauff; she’s a tremendous athlete. One of the best female athletes in the world in any sport, and she’s obviously one of the best tennis players in the world, if not maybe the best at this moment.” Gauff has been given a tricky draw in the opening round against compatriot and 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, but if she gets some momentum behind her, look to see the young American shine in Melbourne. If Gauff doesn’t win her maiden Australian Open crown, then it’s difficult to see any other player beyond world No. 1 Sabalenka or No. 2 Świątek taking the title, such is the dominance of the top three on tour. But Sabalenka remains the favorite for a reason. The two-time defending champion is aiming to become the first woman since Martina Hingis between 1997 and 1999 to win three straight Australian Open titles. Her precision and relentless power are particularly potent weapons on the fast hard courts Down Under and will provide the sternest test yet of Gauff’s new forehand grip should the pair meet in the semifinals. This is the first time in her career that Sabalenka, who also has a tricky first-round draw against 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens, has entered a grand slam as the top seed after she recently took the No. 1 spot in the rankings from Świątek. After not dropping a single set en route to defending her title last year, Sabalenka is unquestionably yet again the player to beat in Australia. “Sabalenka is a slight favorite in my eyes. She really is a hard-court specialist, who has a good chance of winning, even on clay and on grass,” Wilander said. While the fast conditions in Melbourne are not Świątek’s favorite surface, she will no doubt remain a threat at the Australian Open. The five-time grand slam champion’s best performance Down Under came when she reached the semifinals in 2022, but she hasn’t been past the fourth round in all of her other attempts. The end of Świątek’s 2024 season was disrupted by a one-month suspension after she tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine (TMZ). The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) said they found Świątek’s “level of fault was considered to be at the lowest end of the range for ‘No Significant Fault or Negligence’” and accepted her explanation that the positive test was “caused by the contamination of a regulated non-prescription medication.” Świątek missed three tournaments as a result and had to forfeit the ranking points and prize money she won at the Cincinnati Open, which led to Sabalenka overtaking her as world No. 1. “I think Iga is probably full of revenge for many reasons – the biggest being that she lost her No. 1 ranking to Aryna Sabalenka,” Wilander told Eurosport. “She has a new coach (Wim Fissette) in her corner. She’s not always going to be the best player in the world, but she’s going to be knocking on the door to the No. 1 ranking for at least another five years. “She’s too serious. She’s too good. She’s too complete. Yes, she has a problem against some of the big hitters on the women’s tour, but so does everybody else too. Not much is going to change her mindset or her drive, or her ambition and motivation to be the absolute best version of herself every single day she steps on the court. “It’s not the perfect conditions for Iga Świątek, but at the same time, you’ve got to be fit, you’ve got to be ready to go and she’s always ready to go. I think she will have a good tournament; she’s not one of the favorites to win it, but she certainly could cause an upset and win the Australian Open.”"
Emma Raducanu snubs treatment for insect bites over heightened doping concerns,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/sport/emma-raducanu-insect-bites-doping-spt-intl/index.html,"British tennis star Emma Raducanu says she turned down treatment for insect bites ahead of this year’s Australian Open over concerns about what she could be putting in her body. The 22-year-old told reporters that she had been badly bitten by bugs during her preparation for the tournament but decided to “tough it out” without medication due to heightened doping concerns across the sport. “I would say all of us are probably quite sensitive to what we take onboard, and what we use,” Raducanu said. “Yesterday, for example, I got really badly bitten by like ants, mosquitoes, something. I’m allergic, I guess, so they flared up and swelled up really a lot. “Someone was giving me this antiseptic spray, you know, natural, to try and ease the bites but I didn’t want to take it. I didn’t want to spray it. “I was just left there with my swollen ankle and hand. I was like, I’m just going to tough it out because I don’t want to risk it.” It comes amid two high-profile doping cases which shook the world of tennis last year involving Jannik Sinner and Iga Świątek . World No. 1 Sinner has so far avoided suspension from competition since the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced in August that he wasn’t at fault despite testing positive for Clostebol, an anabolic steroid, at low levels from a sample that was collected on March 10. Sinner has said the positive tests stemmed from “inadvertent contamination of Clostebol” through treatment from his physiotherapist. However, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said in September that it was lodging an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after an independent tribunal, convened by the ITIA, found Sinner wasn’t culpable. The appeal will be heard between April 16-17, according to CAS. Meanwhile, former women’s world No. 1 Świątek accepted a one-month suspension last year after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, which can boost endurance. Świątek, a five-time grand slam winner, initially said she was “shocked” at the results and told reporters this week that the period was the “worst time in my life.” Tests found that her supply of melatonin, which Świątek said she took to help her sleep, was contaminated. With both Świątek and Sinner still navigating the fallout from their cases, Raducanu said she is perhaps more sensitive than before. “It’s obviously a concern on our mind but we’re all in the same boat. I think it’s just how we manage as best as we can the controllables,” she added. “If something out of our control happens, then it’s going to be a bit of a struggle to try and prove.” Raducanu is set to face Russian Ekaterina Alexandrova on Monday in the first round of this year’s Australian Open."
Coco Gauff earns statement win over Iga Świątek to lead the US to United Cup title,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/06/sport/coco-gauff-iga-swiatek-united-cup-spt-intl/index.html,"Coco Gauff led the United States to its second United Cup title with a statement 6-4, 6-4 win over world No. 2 Iga Świątek a week before the start of the Australian Open. Gauff, the world No. 3, has now won two straight matches against Świątek after previously winning just one of their first 12 meetings, with one of the main rivalries on the women’s tour now looking less lopsided. “I have the belief that I’m one of the best players in the world and, when I play good tennis, I’m hard to beat,” Gauff said, per the WTA. “Today, I think I played some great tennis. I’m glad I was able to get a point for Team USA. It was tough today, I’m not gonna lie. “It’s great to win a team event, the only team event I’ve ever won, so I’m super excited.” The US walked away with its second title in three years since the inaugural United Cup in 2023 as Taylor Fritz beat Hubert Hurkacz 6-4, 5-7, 7-6(4) to secure a 2-0 win over Poland in the final. But it was Gauff and Świątek’s match that was the big draw of the day and the two stars didn’t disappoint, providing fans with almost two hours of scintillating tennis. After previously beating Świątek in November en route to winning the WTA Finals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Gauff will likely now be feeling supremely confident she can beat anyone she faces once the Australian Open begins on January 12. Gauff, who had a perfect record in singles and doubles throughout the week, reached her first Australian Open semifinal last year where she lost to eventual champion and current world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, while Świątek reached the last four in 2022. However, Świątek left the court in apparent discomfort on Sunday after taking a medical timeout late in the second set to strap her left thigh. Elsewhere, Sabalenka continued preparing for the defense of her Australian Open title by winning the Brisbane International. The world No. 1 was made to work hard for her victory against world No. 107 Polina Kudermetova, fighting back from a set down to win 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. Sabalenka is bidding to become the first woman to win three straight Australian Open titles since Martina Hingis achieved the feat between 1997 and 1999. “I definitely feel my game pretty well,” Sabalenka said, per the WTA. “Mentally, physically, I’ll be ready to go at the Australian Open. Really happy with the way the week went. Having this trophy going to the major, it’s really important. “I definitely feel confident in my game. I’m just excited. I love playing there. I love to fight for my dream. That’s the conditions where I feel really comfortable in. I’m just super exciting heading to the Australia Open.” Meanwhile, Naomi Osaka reached her first final since 2022 but was forced to retire injured after winning the opening set 6-4 against Denmark’s Clara Tauson at the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand. Osaka returned to tennis at the start of 2024 after spending more than a year away from the sport prioritizing her mental health and then becoming a mother. The four-time grand slam champion appeared to be suffering with an abdominal injury and looked tearful as she waited for the trainer. It was an unfortunate end to an impressive week of tennis from Osaka, who is bidding to win her first title since the 2021 Australian Open. “I just want to thank everyone for welcoming me to such a beautiful city,” Osaka said, per AP. “I had a lot of fun playing here, and I’m really sorry about how it ended, but I hope that you enjoyed the tennis that we did play. I’m just really grateful to be here.”"
Ravens bully the Steelers in the first half and don’t look back in 28-14 wild-card victory,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/12/sport/ravens-steelers-nfl-wild-card/index.html,"The Baltimore Ravens are going to go as far as Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson can carry them. And if Saturday night’s dominant win over the Pittsburgh Steelers is any indication, that could take them all the way to New Orleans. The thunder-and-lightning duo highlighted a Baltimore running attack that went for a team postseason record of 299 yards, pacing the Ravens to a 28-14 win over their AFC North rivals. Henry ran for 186 yards on 26 tough carries, punishing the Steeler defense repeatedly with tough runs right into the teeth of the defensive line. He found the right seams, breaking for a long touchdown run and a shorter bruiser for his two scores. Jackson meanwhile was electric as only he can be. He rushed 15 times for 81 yards while also completing 16 of 21 passes for 175 yards and two touchdowns. The rowdy 70,000 fans at M&T Bank Stadium routinely serenaded their star with chants of “M-V-P!” and it’s hard to make the case that anyone else is truly better than the dual-threat quarterback when he’s on top of his game. Jackson said after the game that Henry reminded him of Lightning McQueen from the movie “Cars.” “You know when Lightning McQueen just flying, flashing past?” Jackson said. “That’s how Derrick looks when he’s passing all those guys. And it look like a movie, bro.” “Everyone sees it like, I just hand the ball off and (smacks hands together) 10 yards, 20 yards, 30 yards,” he added, “And I’m just chilling, you know? So now, when they attacking him then I go (and) I’m fresh. It makes my job a lot easier.” Jackson and Henry simply ran through, around and over the Steelers’ defense on a massive drive to start the game, going 95 yards to open the scoring. The biggest play of the drive was Henry taking a direct snap and finding a seam in the Steelers’ front seven, bursting for 34 yards in a play that was punctuated by a brutal stiff arm that sent Steelers star safety Minkah Fitzpatrick reeling. Head coach John Harbaugh said that play was put into the playbook specifically for this game against the Steelers. But the score came on Jackson making an MVP-level throw to Rashod Bateman, cutting across the middle of the Pittsburgh defense in the back of the end zone. Bateman caught the ball and rolled through, securing it to put the Ravens up 7-0. The drive set the tone for the rest of the game as Henry and Jackson used their legs to punish the Steelers’ defense. The sequence that best told the story was an 85-yard, 13-play drive in the second quarter that featured exactly zero passes. Jackson broke loose for a big 19-yard run that left him feeling some discomfort, but it didn’t seem to slow him down as he scrambled for gains on the next two plays before handing the ball off to Henry for another bruising run as the Ravens neared the red zone. “I just think Lamar was seeing it, and he was doing a great job of pulling it and making plays and getting the most out of a play,” Henry said in the locker room after the game. “And guys did a great job blocking for it to open up.” A sweep to Henry put the Ravens inside the 10-yard line after a 17-yard pickup and the Steelers defense seemed to have no answer for the punishing running attack. Henry pounded through the tackles one more time to get into the end zone, putting an exclamation point on a physically dominating drive. “I was focused on doing my job each and every play. Credit to the offensive line, doing a great job. Tight ends, receivers and fullbacks blocking for me and for us to have a successful offense,” he said. And when the Ravens wanted to move fast, they could do that too. Just before halftime, Jackson led his offense down the field in 1:51, punctuating an incredible first half with a third touchdown to put Baltimore up 21-0 going into the break. “He runs around and finds a touchdown pass. And I think I just think in his head, he knows what 11 seconds is,” Harbaugh said. “It goes a little faster for me, I was like, ‘Throw that thing away!” You know, it’s like, all I could say is wow.” The Steelers looked a bit more lively coming out of the locker room, stopping Baltimore on their first drive before getting on the board for the first time with a 30-yard pass from Russell Wilson to wide receiver Van Jefferson. It was the first sign of life for Pittsburgh, and the Ravens looked to stamp it out immediately on the following drive. Returning to the run game, Henry found a seam in the Pittsburgh defense and took a 44-yard run to the house that seemed to put Baltimore on easy street. Wilson wasn’t going away though. Having found success going over the top of the Ravens defense on the Steelers’ first drive of the second half, Wilson went back to that strategy and connected with wideout George Pickens for another long touchdown, this time for 36 yards making the score 28-14. The Steelers held the Ravens to their first three-and-out of the game on the next drive and suddenly Pittsburgh looked back in business. But the Ravens defense stiffened at the right time, sacking Wilson with defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike delivering a crunching sack on a third-down play to force a punt as the third quarter came to an end. The Ravens went back to their tough ground game to eat up some more clock before punting the ball back to the Steelers midway through the quarter. A nice return from Calvin Austin III put the ball at the Steelers 25-yard line with 8:36 to go in the game and Pittsburgh needing two touchdowns. An appearance from Ravens legend Ray Lewis got the fans hyped up before the critical drive, a must-score sequence for the Steelers. Another big pass from Russell Wilson to Pickens, this one for 26 yards to move the ball to the Baltimore 38-yard line, put the Steelers in a threatening position. Having found no luck on the ground, the Steelers have turned almost exclusively to the deep pass in the second half as their offensive threat and found success. But the thing about those pass plays is that they need time to develop. Another sack, this one from Odafe Oweh, put the Steelers in a tough position. Left with a fourth-and-15 play, Wislon went over the top again into triple coverage in the end zone. The pass was knocked down by Ar’Darius Washington, turning the ball back over to the Ravens offense. The combination of Jackson and Henry took the ball right into the teeth of the Steeler defense and found success. Jackson picked up a big first down on a third-and-short to keep the drive moving near midfield, and – not for the first time in the game – came looking like he was in some pain. “It’s kind of the Ravens way too,” Harbaugh said of the tough style of football played on Saturday. “I think if you look back, you look at Baltimore, you know, since 2000 … it’s been the run, defense, special teams. But Lamar’s added a little flavor to that whole thing and we’re throwing the ball well too.” A defensive holding penalty on the Steelers gave the Ravens a free first down with a little more than three minutes to go. One play later, a sweep to Henry nearly picked up another as the running back powered for eight yards and only just was stopped from taking it to the house. Instead, the Ravens just picked up one more crucial third down on a direct snap to tight end Mark Andrews and were able to take a knee to ice it. If the Ravens continue to block and run the way they did on Saturday night, it’s hard to find a defense in the NFL that’s going to be able to stop them. There was little back-patting in the locker room after the game as the Ravens looked forward to Sunday’s slate of games and figuring out whether they’ll play at home or on the road next week, but to Jackson it doesn’t matter. “It don’t matter. We’ve been on the road all season, we ready,” he said."
Yankees fans who interfered with Mookie Betts during World Series banned from all MLB games,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/11/sport/yankees-fans-mookie-betts-banned-mlb-spt-intl/index.html,"Major League Baseball has banned two fans who interfered with Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts during a World Series game at Yankee Stadium from attending any games at big league ballparks. MLB sent a letter to Austin Capobianco and John P. Hansen this week informing them of the decision. “On Oct. 29, 2024, during Game 4 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium, you interfered with play by intentionally and forcefully grabbing a player. Your conduct posed a serious risk to the health and safety of the player and went far over the line of acceptable fan behavior,” said the letter, the contents of which were first reported by the New York Post and later obtained by The Associated Press. “Based on your conduct, Major League Baseball is banning you indefinitely from all MLB stadiums, offices, and other facilities,” the letter said. “You are also hereby banned indefinitely from attending any events sponsored by or associated with MLB. Please be advised that if you are discovered at any MLB property or event, you will be removed from the premises and subject to arrest for trespass.” MLB has previously issued league-wide bans for fans who trespass on the field or threaten baseball personnel. A fan who approached Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. at Colorado’s Coors Field in 2023 received a similar ban. Capobianco and Hansen were ejected from the game on Oct. 29 and banned from Game 5 the following night. Betts leaped at the retaining wall in foul territory and caught Gleyber Torres’ pop fly in the first inning, but a fan in the first row with a gray Yankees road jersey grabbed Betts’ glove with both hands and pulled the ball out. Another fan grabbed Betts’ bare hand. The Yankees called the behavior “egregious and unacceptable.” The team said Friday the two fans MLB banned were not season ticket holders."
"Cleveland Browns QB Deshaun Watson tears Achilles for second time in less than three months, undergoes another surgery",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/sport/deshaun-watson-tears-achilles-for-second-time-spt/index.html,"Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson has undergone another surgery after rupturing his right Achilles for a second time, the team announced Friday. The setback puts a question mark on whether Watson will see the field in 2025. He already was in the middle of rehabilitation after he suffered the Achilles tear the first time. “Watson’s recovery time and return to play status is uncertain, and he will likely miss significant time during the 2025 season,” the Browns said in a statement Friday. Watson’s latest surgery to repair the injury was Thursday, the team said. It’s his second surgery on the Achilles in less than three months. Watson, 29, initially suffered the injury October 20 in Cleveland’s loss at home against the Cincinnati Bengals. At the time, the Browns said a full recovery was expected. He had the first surgery October 25. “Earlier this week, when Watson reported to the CrossCountry Mortgage Campus for his exit physical as part of the Browns’ season-ending process, he complained of discomfort after rolling his ankle in Miami,” the Browns said Friday. “MRI results demonstrated a re-rupture to his Achilles tendon.” Both surgeries were performed by Dr. Bob Anderson, a foot and ankle specialist in Charlotte, North Carolina. This was Watson’s third season with the Browns. He has yet to play a full season for Cleveland, and the Browns are 9-10 when he has been their starting quarterback. After Watson went down, the Browns used Jameis Winston, Dorian Thompson-Robinson and Bailey Zappe at quarterback. The Browns acquired Watson in March 2022, trading three first-round picks as part of the deal, and went on to give him a five-year, fully guaranteed $230 million contract. He has two years left on the contract. ESPN, citing unnamed sourcing, reported late last month that Watson and the team agreed to rework his contract to add void years and move his dead salary cap into 2030. Watson, who has been named in dozens of civil lawsuits on behalf of women alleging the quarterback sexually harassed or assaulted them, was suspended for the first 11 games of the 2022 season for violating the league’s personal conduct policy when he was with the Houston Texans. In 2023, Watson’s season was cut short because of a shoulder injury. The Browns went 3-14 this season and hold the No. 2 pick in the upcoming NFL draft."
Standout LSU wide receiver Kyren Lacy wanted by police following deadly hit-and-run crash,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/10/sport/lsu-kyren-lacy-sought-following-deadly-hit-and-run-crash-spt/index.html,"Louisiana State Police have issued an arrest warrant for LSU wide receiver Kyren Lacy following a fatal December 17 crash in Lafourche Parish. Police said the 24-year-old, who has spent the last three seasons with the Tigers, is wanted for negligent homicide, felony hit-and-run and reckless operation of a vehicle after police said Lacy caused an automobile accident that killed 78-year-old Herman Hall and injured two other people. Lacy’s agent, Rocky Arceneaux, said the football player was aware of the allegations and is cooperating with authorities. Arceneaux said the facts of the case “will ultimately demonstrate the truth, but we respect the need for a full and thorough investigation.” Arceneaux said the matter “is being taken very seriously, and we are committed to resolving it responsibly.” CNN has reached out to Lacy through his lawyer for comment. A fifth-year senior, Lacy started 12 games this past season catching 58 passes for 866 yards. He led the Tigers with nine touchdown catches and accepted an invitation to play in the 2025 Senior Bowl on February 1. CNN has reached out to LSU for comment. According to a police news release, Lacy was behind the wheel of a 2023 Dodge Charger, driving “recklessly” and illegally passing other vehicles while driving at a “high rate of speed.” He is accused of “crossing the centerline and entering the northbound lane while in a designated No-Passing Zone.” The police state that Lacy’s actions caused the driver of a 2017 Kia Cadenza to swerve over the centerline to avoid impact with the Charger. The Cadenza then “collided head-on with a southbound 2017 Kia Sorento.” Hall was a passenger in the Sorento and died from his injuries after being transported to a hospital, according to the news release. The drivers of both cars involved in the collision were injured. CNN affiliate WAFB reports Hall was a former US Marine. Police investigators state Lacy left the area after the accident – driving “around the crash scene and fled south on LA Hwy 20 without stopping to render aid, call emergency services, or report his involvement in the crash.” The police state that they have been in contact with Lacy and his legal team to turn himself in. On December 19, two days after the accident, Lacy posted on X that he was declaring for the 2025 NFL draft."

"These athletes suffered life-changing injuries. Then, they turned to psychedelics",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/19/sport/psilocybin-athletes-life-changing-injuries-psychedelics-spt-intl/index.html,"Daniel Carcillo wanted two things in life: to play hockey and to be a father. The Canadian started ice skating aged three and got his start in professional ice hockey as soon as he graduated high school. By 20 he’d broken into the NHL and over the next decade would play for the Philadelphia Flyers, New York Rangers and Los Angeles Kings. By 30, he was a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Chicago Blackhawks and, in 2015, had retired from the sport, poised to enjoy retirement with his wife and three children, he says. By age 31, he was suicidal. After seven diagnosed concussions, Carcillo tells CNN that he was suffering from “dementia-like” symptoms, along with depression, anxiety and headaches, so much so that even a day out with his kids felt torturous. “If they want to go outside on a very sunny day, and I can’t find my dark glasses to block the sun out … I would try to go outside and tough it … that would trigger a headache, and that would trigger head pressure,” Carcillo tells CNN Sport. “Your impulse control is off,” he explained. “It would be miserable … Eventually, I would just go inside.” Carcillo says he also suffered from insomnia and disrupted sleep and would go to bed at 4 or 5 a.m., trying to sleep as much as he could during the day so that he wasn’t around anybody or in the sun. “It’s a very lonely place to be,” he says. He spent over $500,000 on prescription medications and treatments at stroke rehabilitation centers, brain centers, and concussion centers, as well as holistic therapies, and worried that he was a “burden in people’s lives.” Then in a “last-ditch effort” to try and alleviate his symptoms, he says he took a dose of psilocybin – the main psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms – in Denver, which became the first US city to decriminalize hallucinogenic mushrooms. “And I woke up the next day and I describe it as feeling the way I should,” said Carcillo. “I felt like, for the first time in a very, very long time, I had a zest for life. All I wanted to do was get on FaceTime and call my wife and call my kids and get back home.” Carcillo isn’t the only athlete – former or current – openly talking about using psychedelics to treat various conditions. Psychedelics, described by Harvard Health as a “loosely grouped class of drugs that are able to induce altered thoughts and sensory perceptions” - including acid (LSD), mushrooms (psilocybin), ecstasy (MDMA), ayahuasca, DMT (dimethyltryptamine) and ketamine - have a checkered legal history. In 2022, residents in Colorado joined Oregon in voting to legalize psilocybin. Small clinical trials have shown that one or two doses of psilocybin, given in a therapeutic setting, can make dramatic and long-lasting changes in people suffering from treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, though scientists are still exploring the how and the why behind the connection between psychedelics and improved mental health. Last year, Australia became the first country in the world to legalize clinical prescribing of MDMA, more commonly known as ecstasy, and psilocybin for certain mental health disorders. But experts also warn that taking psilocybin and other hallucinogens comes with potential health risks, such as psychosis or other longer-term mental health issues in some, as well as physical effects such as raised blood pressure and heart rate abnormalities. NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers has continued to advocate for the legalization of some psychedelics, claiming last year that ayahuasca – a drink made from Amazonian plants that contain a psychoactive ingredient – helped to improve his performance on the football field. “Is it not ironic that the things that actually expand your mind are illegal and the things that keep you in the lower chakras [energy points in the body] and dumb you down have been legal for centuries?” Rodgers said last year at a psychedelics conference in Denver. Former pro boxer Mike Tyson has said that magic mushrooms changed his life, and UFC President Dana White in 2021 said the organization was “diving in” to research on psychedelic drugs as a therapy for fighters’ brain health. Elite athletes experience mental health disorder symptoms and psychological distress at similar, if not higher, rates to the general population, researchers pointed out in a study published in the Journal of Applied Sport Psychology. Courtney Walton, an academic fellow in psychology at Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, told CNN that many athletes fear seeking mental health support, believing “they may be perceived as somehow less competent or resilient than their peers and competitors, which can be made worse by upcoming team or coaching selection pressures. He added that “athletes might overlook or normalize symptoms of mental ill-health, as rationalized within a highly pressurized environment.” Walton explained it is “likely that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy has particular appeal to athletes given the more time-constrained nature of treatment.” He added that “psychedelics do not typically appear to have significant physical side effects” which could appeal to athletes who have experienced or heard of negative experiences with psychiatric medicine affecting performance. UFC Senior Vice President of Athlete Health and Performance Jeff Novitzky said in May 2021 that White gave him a “directive” to explore psychedelic research to see if it helps with addiction and mental-health problems, as well as traumatic brain injury. Novitzky told CNN the UFC is interested in any therapies that have the potential to improve brain health, and that the organization has had discussions with experts from institutions like Johns Hopkins and the University of Miami about the potential application of psychedelics, though nothing has progressed past preliminary conversations at this stage. “All the scientists that we’ve talked to said, ‘Hey, there’s a potential real benefit here to treat brain injuries and for brain health,’” said Novitzky, adding there is still negative stigma associated with some drugs, citing cannabis. Three years ago, the UFC changed its anti-doping policy so that ”positive tests over the threshold and decision limit for carboxy-THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, will no longer be considered a violation of the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, unless additional evidence exists that an athlete used it intentionally for performance-enhancing purposes,” according to a news release posted on their site in 2021. Researchers in the field say that psychedelics are shown to work when treating some mental health conditions. “The case is compelling when you look at this as a psychological treatment, where you might be treating depression or more or less any other psychiatric disorder with a couple of exceptions,” Robin Carhart-Harris, Ralph Metzner Distinguished Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at University of California San Francisco, told CNN Sport. However, when it comes to treating brain injuries with psychedelics, “the truth of the matter is that there’s a lot that’s not known,” Carhart-Harris, former head of the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, added. “There is an increasing amount of evidence to suggest that psychedelics promote aspects of brain growth,” he says, adding: “We need that smoking gun: a clear demonstration of this in an injured brain where we see regeneration afterwards. And at the moment, we’re close, but no cigar,” he said. Carhart-Harris warned that psychedelics are “potent” and have the power to make people “psychologically agitated” when they are already psychologically vulnerable. “People think they can just turn on, tune in and cure themselves. And it’s not that simple,” he added, explaining that if psychedelics aren’t paired with psychological support or psychotherapy they can be “harmful.” James Rucker, a consultant psychiatrist and a senior clinical lecturer at King’s College London, said that evidence has shown that psilocybin can be used to manage treatment-resistant depression but warns that psychedelics are “very hyped,” with people having “huge expectations” as to their impacts. “With great expectation comes great capacity for disappointment,” Rucker said, adding that while this can often be dealt with positively in a medical setting, “if you’re on your own, if you’re in a crappy situation, that can make things worse.” Following the head injuries sustained during his hockey career, the now 39-year-old Carcillo began struggling with depression and anxiety and was self-medicating with alcohol, painkillers, muscle relaxers and sleep aids. Suffering from slurred speech, weight loss and memory issues, he became “very disinterested in life” after the birth of his first child. “I just didn’t care, which was very weird that I felt that disconnected because I’ve always wanted to be a dad. It was kind of scary,” he said. Carcillo was one of several hundred players who accused the NHL of failing to prevent hockey-related head trauma and hiding the dangers. The lawsuit was settled in 2018, with the league not accepting liability for the claims. In 2019, by now a father of three, Carcillo found himself in a “very, very dark, dark place. I didn’t think I had a way out.” He began reading medical papers and found a psilocybin study from the Imperial College of London, where researchers found “the psychedelic compound may effectively reset the activity of key brain circuits known to play a role in depression.” That’s when Carcillo traveled to a decriminalized city and “partook in a really large dose ceremony,” taking the psilocybin recreationally and not part of a clinical study. Later, he founded Wesana Health, a biotechnology company which focuses on developing psychedelic medicine for mental health, the most recent being a CBD and psilocybin-based drug. The company met with the US Food and Drug Administration in March 2022 and has been working through the early drug development process, and recently sold the program to NASDAQ-listed Lucy Scientific Discovery. He is no longer involved in the company. He told CNN that he regularly microdoses psilocybin, as well as partaking in larger doses from time to time. “I continue to monitor my health with regular brain scans and blood work, and adjust my dosing schedule of medicinal mushrooms accordingly,” he added. Carcillo is clear that his current well-being isn’t solely due to psilocybin, saying he exercises regularly, is careful to manage his sleep as well as sugar and alcohol intake, and makes sure to get out and about in the sunshine. Former US rugby player Anna Symonds says she was diagnosed with TBI about 10 years ago and has to take several different hormones that her body – notably her pituitary gland –  is not making as a result of the head injuries. Now retired from rugby, Symonds tells CNN Sport she has started to feel the effects of injuries to her body and head from years of participating in contact sports like rugby, soccer and mixed martial arts as well as being involved in two car crashes. “I was physically not feeling well. In addition to my pituitary issues, I have an autoimmune issue with my thyroid,” she explains, adding that she also experiences headaches, memory issues, depression and anxiety. She began using psychedelics to help with this, taking part in “macrodose-level journeys or ceremonies with mushrooms, LSD, ayahuasca and Toad.” Also known as the Colorado River toad or the Sonoran Desert toad, the amphibian releases a venom called 5-MeO-DMT, which is known to have hallucinogenic effects, according to the Addiction Center website, which also warns of its dangers. Symonds used a synthetic form of the compound, which does not harm the toads. Since her retirement as an athlete, Symonds explains that she uses psychedelic drugs for clarity, though not under the direction of a doctor. She adds that using cannabis for pain relief or using psilocybin does not necessarily elicit dramatic changes compared with other plant-based psychedelics. “It’s this groove, it’s the spiral that you can’t seem to get out of, and it just almost reinforces itself. The experience of plant medicines is for me, like psychedelics, is that it lifts you out of the groove.” Guidance from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) states that the effects of psychedelic and dissociative drugs may be difficult to predict and depend on many factors. Short-term side effects from the drugs can include headaches, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, high blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, trembling and diarrhea, the NIH notes, though it adds that reported cases of side-effects likely represent only a very small number of users. Rucker tells CNN: “I feel I need to draw a clear line between what we do in our clinical trials - which is safe and contained - and recreational use, which can be therapeutic, but can be dangerous, and is, by definition, experimental.” Rucker added that it’s important not to overhype the effects of substances like psilocybin for mental health conditions, as other treatments including antidepressants, lithium, cognitive behavior therapy, meditation and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can have similar effects. “They’re special, they’re unique, but they’re not that special,” says Rucker. “They’re just drugs. And we need to work out where they sit and not be too gung-ho with them.” Rucker says that more education is needed around psychedelics, as regardless of a country’s laws, people will continue to take these substances. “We need to make sure that people are doing their homework and not treating this as a recreational drug like any other but actually treating it with the respect it deserves,” he tells CNN. Carhart-Harris explains “all aspects of mental illness can fall on anyone, whether they be a sportsperson or not.” Still, he adds that psychedelics could be harnessed to enhance sporting performance, through enhancing discipline or helping people to process pressure or failure. “Then you have the sort of positive psychology side, where you could use, for example, low doses of psychedelics to enhance some of the training, say, getting more into one’s body, more easily entering flow states, intense focus, not being too heady and cerebral. I think there is real potential for using psychedelics in a sort of skillful way,” Carhart-Harris says. Symonds adds: “Medicines don’t just have to be a treatment for when you’re sick or ill or broken, they can be something that you take to keep you well or to enhance your wellness, your wellbeing, your spirituality.”"
A doping free-for-all Enhanced Games calls itself the answer to doping in sports. Opponents say it poses a danger to health,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html,"The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world’s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what “faster, higher, stronger” – the former motto of the Games – might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an “alternative” to what it calls the “corrupt Olympics Games.” Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won’t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That’s quite a contrast to the Olympics’ doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024’s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that “the idea does not merit any comment.” CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia’s state-sponsored doping program – a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 – said that the Enhanced Games is a “danger to health, to sport.” Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D’Souza. He is also the founding editor of “The Journal Jurisprudence,” a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an “avid athlete.” Recently, D’Souza told CNN Sport he has “signed term sheets with prominent venture capital firms” in relation to the Enhanced Games and is “waiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.” He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D’Souza believes what he calls a “science-driven” competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes’ blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they’re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a “robust way” of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: “Determining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,” explaining that, since 2017, a “prevalence working group” has been established to “determine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.” WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered “several recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.” WADA has reservations about Faiss’ study and pointed to the “complexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,” highlighting that reports have “greatly varying results.” The anti-doping organization added: “No single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.” “Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. “In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. “The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.” Editor’s note: You can find WADA’s full statement at the bottom of this article. Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is “farcical … likely illegal in many [US] states” and “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.” Substances such as anabolic steroids – which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts – are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “we will not be drug testing at the games.” He added: “We do not propose to regulate what athletes use.” Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn’t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. “If you look at the Enhanced Games website, it’s almost as though they’re advertising their disregard of the law,” Walden told CNN Sport. “They wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. “I hope they’re thinking hard about how they’re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that’s focusing on these very issues.” The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to “protect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,” according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, “degrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.” “The use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,” Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. “Promotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. “It might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.” Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games’ organizers “might get investigated […] under the Rodchenkov Act.” The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don’t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn’t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 – “Prohibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person” – of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA’s Tygart also told CNN Sport: “No one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.” D’Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn’t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he’d continue to be a “quiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.” “I do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one’s interested in histories in the past anymore,” said D’Souza. “They’re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.” According to Pierre de Coubertin – the founder of the modern Olympics – “for every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.” Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called “the dirtiest Olympics in history.” When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event’s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists – notably the winner, Ben Johnson – who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep “elite podiums and finals clean,” according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year’s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. “It’s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,” said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is “getting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.” By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. “Athletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,” he said, adding that “EPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.” Athletes “use the drugs that are actively working.” When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat – the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance – Faiss said athletes “are likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.” Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are “seeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won’t be caught,” said Faiss. Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will “give a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we’re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.” Verroken also questions what’s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is “setting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.” Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it “dangerous and irresponsible,” saying that “the world needs better than this.” UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it “is extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,” adding that “there is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.” UKAD’s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a “hugely dangerous precedent,” expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. When CNN Sport spoke to D’Souza shortly after the proposed event’s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization’s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that “very accomplished athletes” at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out “to understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.” Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers “already have an Olympic medallist” for their athlete commission, though he didn’t specify who that was. He also said there has been “a lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.” Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories – track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion – almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC’s philosophy of “lower-impact Games” in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D’Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to “deliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games” so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt’s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. “I’ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said […] if there’s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I’ll be there,” said D’Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an “enhanced athletes programme.” When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “our athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.” He said: “We will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.” “This will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.” D’Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D’Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. “We’re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,” added D’Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would “never” coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. “Having been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won’t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],” Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D’Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even “undermine the very purpose of the sport in question.” Devine told CNN Sport that “performance-enhancing drugs don’t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.” He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: “To what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes’ sporting excellence?” WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a Working Group on Doping Prevalence in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group’s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures."
These young female athletes died by suicide. They all had head injuries in common,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/05/sport/head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd/index.html,"Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common. Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain’s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival. Both were incredibly smart – Catlin was studying for a master’s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father. At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience. Yet these two women’s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine. However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury. Women’s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men’s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. “It’s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,” McKee added. “We do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don’t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,” she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women’s necks could play a part. Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team. Catlin’s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was “intense” and “ambitious,” attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn’t her first crash – she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn’t have any symptoms at the time. But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache. “She couldn’t compete,” her father said. “Kelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she’s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.” On closer inspection, Catlin’s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford’s Health Centre. A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. “There wasn’t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,” he told CNN. CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment. Catlin’s symptoms didn’t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but “she would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,” according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with “no exercise tolerance whatsoever,” he added. Her injury had other consequences. “As far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,” her father told CNN. “She basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn’t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that’s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,” he added. At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life. Soutter’s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter – not only was she an “adrenaline junkie,” but she was “very conscientious” and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France. Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school – and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013. “It was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,” her father said. “She just made it look graceful and beautiful.” But training took its toll – Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018. “I was being advised by doctors “Oh, don’t worry, she’s young enough she’ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,” he told CNN. “With every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,” he added. “I was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.” But Soutter’s final concussion was so “huge” that she spent two nights in the hospital. “When I got there, she didn’t even know who I was or where she was,” her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide. Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was “absolutely fine” and could continue competing. Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia. “She would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she’d go blind. She’d not be able to see – everything would go black and dark,” her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event. In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport. “As Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,” a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. “She was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity – training or competition – overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,” they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: “We take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.” Catlin and Soutter aren’t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age. “For someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,” Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay’s brain, told CNN. “We haven’t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,” he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn’t done peer reviewed research on this.  “But what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains – this is not normal for someone of that age.” Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing “behavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can’t suppress impulses the way you normally could.” With these emotional problems, “they would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,” Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them “from being the person that they were before their injury.” Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was “a combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.” There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women. A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open. Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle. McKee said all athletes can also experience “non-concussive” injuries: “hits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don’t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.” Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts – including concussion and non- concussive injuries – increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said. The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is “associated with recurrent concussions.” But scientists aren’t only concerned about concussions. Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts – repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms – can still result in long-term neurological disease. According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, “the best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.” There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely “equally important,” McKee said. “We also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,” she said. “We’re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,” she said. McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. “The problem is the subclinical hits – the non-concussive injuries that aren’t detected, you don’t pull the player off the field – and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,” she explained. Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men. In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes – but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn’t have any women in a sample of participants at all. There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women’s health and brain injury, told CNN. There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don’t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren’t spotted as routinely. “They tend to push really hard through the injury,” she said. And many women can’t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. “When they really crater, it’s a couple of days or weeks later.” Snedaker said female athletes often weren’t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn’t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin’s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents. She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found “they were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,” her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added. She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital – but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN. “Wherever she turned she could not find help,” he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a “stoic, female warrior type person that isn’t going to admit that she’s struggling.” “She needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.” Her father said a major factor in his daughter’s death was “a lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly’s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren’t,” he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin’s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students’ experiences, “supporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.” “Students in need of mental health crisis assistance – including students having suicidal thoughts – and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,” she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, “there are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.” In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was “devastated” by Catlin’s death, adding: “She brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her. “As the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,” a representative for USA Cycling added. After his daughter Ellie’s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility – the biggest of its kind in the world – of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. “When I actually started looking into CTE – all of the work that they’ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,” Soutter told CNN. “It was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms … Every one that’s involved in CTE was part of Ellie’s life,” he added. “I truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.” Editor’s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

Saudi Arabia is trying to disrupt soccer’s world order. The reasons why might surprise you,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html,"When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbappé – including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year – it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbappé might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (€90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe’s major leagues – France’s Ligue 1, Spain’s La Liga, Italy’s Serie A, Germany’s Bundesliga and the English Premier League – according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation’s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia’s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn’t “care” about the country’s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. “Well if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,” MBS said in an interview with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: “I don’t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we’re going to get that one and a half percent.” Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation’s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world’s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants “to drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,” though it’s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop “young Saudi talent.” During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D’Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (€835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (€353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world’s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees – all international stars – play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was “not in [the SPL’s] competitive advantage” to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (£700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (£12 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers “just aren’t true.” “Essentially, the signal is ‘We mean business,’” Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.“We’ve got so much money that for a player who is … coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he’s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,” Chadwick said, describing Saudi’s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries – including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi’s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country’s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi’s victory over Argentina during last year’s men’s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. “For example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you’re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,” Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of “The Price of Football” podcast. “From the Saudi authorities’ point of view, they’re getting a ready-made product. Everybody’s heard of Benzema. Everybody’s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,” Maguire said. Saudi Arabia’s lofty sporting ambitions don’t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men’s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt – although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between €35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country’s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals – and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30. Of this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia’s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring – and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, “what is just as significant is the security of the royal family,” Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. “What we’re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,” Chadwick said. “You want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it … But don’t question us,” Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer “can be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.” At the same time, there has been “a significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country” this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. “Reputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and … Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,” James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, “The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,” explains. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick – not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. “Part of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that’s a way of attracting interest to the country,” said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of “sportswashing” its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia’s purported “sportswashing,” the kingdom’s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: “People that don’t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they’ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. “See what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,” he added. Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, “they feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.” In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport’s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up “owning golf.” Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men’s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport’s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. “They have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,” he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football’s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. “As far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don’t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don’t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,” he said last month. “When people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they’re playing.” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: “I don’t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. “I don’t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can’t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?” he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is “no different from what the Premier League have done.” “There was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we’re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,” said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league’s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. “We can’t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.”  But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which “simply doesn’t exist in Saudi Arabia,” Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams’ spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy – up from its current value of “0.000 something.” “They’ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,” Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world’s domestic leagues. “That is feasible given the amount of money that they’re spending.” “I think they’re realistic. They don’t say that they’re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,” Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world’s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA’s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA’s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia’s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour’s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league’s financial endeavors, “nobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.” “This vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,” Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is “signaling.” “It is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.”"
